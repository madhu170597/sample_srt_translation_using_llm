1
00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.360
Nice, Babs. 

2
00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:56.800
They're bagels actually. 

3
00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:58.520
Can you not look at me like that? 

4
00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:59.480
I'm your his sister. 

5
00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:00.000
Oh, yeah. 

6
00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:00.560
Sorry. 

7
00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.000
Oh, I feel Darth Baker is close by. 

8
00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:05.760
What do you think, Prue Baker? 

9
00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:09.560
Yeah, you could be right. 

10
00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:10.000
Yeah. 

11
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.120
I shouldn't have taken the stairs. 

12
00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:19.200
I'm knackered. 

13
00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.000
Too many lemon drizzles, mate. 

14
00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.440
Oh, you just burnt my pie. 

15
00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:31.600
It's fine. 

16
00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.120
It's a little on the dark side. 

17
00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.280
Oh, I think my fruit sponge is ready. 

18
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:38.600
Anyone? 

19
00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:39.440
Nah. 

20
00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.000
I think you'll be eating that flan solo. 

21
00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.240
Welcome to the Great. 

22
00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.040
British Bake. 

23
00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.440
Off. 

24
00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.160
No, you look like Billie Eilish's grandmother. 

25
00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.360
You look about for. 

26
00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.640
When I came in, I could see the edges of the tent. 

27
00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:02.200
It's almost here. 

28
00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.240
I am just a few steps away. 

29
00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:09.840
I feel as though I've fallen down a rabbit hole, and the Mad Hatter is going to come running around the corner. 

30
00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:16.160
I cannot wait to walk into that tent, feel what it's like to be one of those people. 

31
00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:18.960
I've never wanted to be in a tent so bad before. 

32
00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.120
From across Britain, thousands of the best home bakers applied. 

33
00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:26.240
Good luck. 

34
00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.240
But just 12 have made it. 

35
00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.840
I've always wanted to apply, but I never had the courage to actually do it this year. 

36
00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:33.840
I thought I'd give it a try. 

37
00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:34.560
And I'm here. 

38
00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:38.560
I work in a supermarket behind the checkouts. 

39
00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.040
This is the biggest thing I've ever done. 

40
00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:43.240
Things like this don't happen to me. 

41
00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.200
You just want to cry because you cannot believe this is real. 

42
00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:48.920
Over the next ten weeks. 

43
00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:49.600
It is going. 

44
00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:49.800
In. 

45
00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:57.080
They'll face 30 brand new challenges designed to put every bit of their baking ability to the test. 

46
00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.800
I've done baking for quite a while. 

47
00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.560
I feel maybe I'm sort of good at this. 

48
00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.360
We're about to find out how good for me, so maybe I'm terrible. 

49
00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:08.720
My partner said, fake it until you make it. 

50
00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:12.000
The stress is real, and that's what I'm doing. 

51
00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.120
Everything they make will be judged by Prue Leith. 

52
00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:18.600
It is utterly delicious. 

53
00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:19.960
And Paul Hollywood. 

54
00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:23.840
I'm intrigued to see if Paul's eyes are as blue as people say in real life. 

55
00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.400
Like a white walker or something. 

56
00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:27.000
Are they? 

57
00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.360
Yeah. 

58
00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:28.120
Yeah, yeah. 

59
00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:29.320
Look into your soul. 

60
00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:32.840
They'll start with astounding cakes. 

61
00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:33.640
Come on. 

62
00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:34.280
Oh, my. 

63
00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:37.560
A batch of Scrumptuous signature sandwiches. 

64
00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:38.520
Oh my God. 

65
00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.120
It's gone all crumbly. 

66
00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.720
Oh. 

67
00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.080
A classic American cake. 

68
00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.680
Yeah. 

69
00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.800
That'll catch some red handed. 

70
00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:46.600
It's gonna high five you. 

71
00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:47.760
But I've seen your palms. 

72
00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:48.480
Good luck. 

73
00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:49.920
Can't stop, can't stop. 

74
00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.080
And a showstopping home bake. 

75
00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:52.640
Oh. 

76
00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:53.200
What? 

77
00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:55.280
It's okay, it's okay. 

78
00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:56.880
It landed the right side up. 

79
00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:57.400
Yes. 

80
00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.960
That'll expose any shaky foundations. 

81
00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:02.200
I'm so worried. 

82
00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.840
Are you all right? 

83
00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:04.280
Yeah. 

84
00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:05.880
Boom! 

85
00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:36.960
After two years away in Essex, we've pitched our tent back in the beautiful grounds of Welford Park. 

86
00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:46.280
And our fresh crop of bakers are about to face three cake based challenges, after which one of them will be crowned Star Baker and one will have to leave the competition. 

87
00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:47.720
Hello, bakers. 

88
00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:49.200
Welcome to the tent. 

89
00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:52.880
And it's time for your first ever signature challenge. 

90
00:04:53.000 --> 00:05:00.320
Today, the judges would love you to make a batch of 12 identical mini sandwich cakes. 

91
00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:00.600
Yeah. 

92
00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:06.200
You know, like Battenberg in a panini, Vicky sponge on sourdough loaf and a tuna melt. 

93
00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:08.120
I think that would be a cake sandwich. 

94
00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:09.440
They're looking for sandwich cakes. 

95
00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:09.840
Oh, good. 

96
00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:10.920
Cos they sounded rank. 

97
00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:11.720
They did sound. 

98
00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:16.920
The shape and flavours are entirely up to you, and you can use any sponge you like. 

99
00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:18.400
You have one hour. 

100
00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:19.200
What 

101
00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:21.480
sandwich? 

102
00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:23.480
Between two half hours. 

103
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:24.800
You have two hours. 

104
00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:26.520
You got two hours on your mark. 

105
00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:27.440
Get set. 

106
00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:28.000
Bake. 

107
00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:28.680
Ooh, 

108
00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:32.160
quite. Little bit stress. 

109
00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:33.080
I'm not gonna lie. 

110
00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:35.440
I just hope that today will go okay. 

111
00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:37.240
Doesn't feel real yet. 

112
00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:37.880
Two hours. 

113
00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:40.880
It's not a long time to make 12 sandwich cakes. 

114
00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.120
I didn't feel great this morning. 

115
00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:44.240
Really nervous. 

116
00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:46.760
It's crazy because you're just making a cake. 

117
00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:48.640
And it's something you do all the time. 

118
00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:51.200
My sandwich cakes. 

119
00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:56.000
This looks like quite a simple challenge, but what we're really looking for is a bit of originality. 

120
00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:02.240
They could choose any sponge they want, but we want it to be small, packed with the flavour full of their personality. 

121
00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:06.640
It's the first time the bakers are going to show us what they can bake, so this is really important. 

122
00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:08.320
We want to see their skills. 

123
00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:10.240
They need to be absolutely identical. 

124
00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:12.160
Absolutely delicious. 

125
00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:13.080
Perfect sandwich. 

126
00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:14.200
Cake is what we want. 

127
00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:16.400
Good morning. 

128
00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:16.960
Rebs. 

129
00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:17.520
Hello, Rebs. 

130
00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:17.920
Good morning. 

131
00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:18.200
Right. 

132
00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:21.480
Tell us all about your mini sandwich cake. 

133
00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:23.160
I'm making hazelnut mocha latte. 

134
00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:26.240
Mini sandwich cakes because I used to work as a barista. 

135
00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:30.400
And it's the drink my boyfriend used to come in and order all the time when he was trying to chat me up. 

136
00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:32.560
So you're approaching this like a barista. 

137
00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:33.040
In a way. 

138
00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:35.480
These two are going to be absolutely pumped. 

139
00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:37.400
The amount of coffees going in it, hopefully. 

140
00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:43.960
Rebs from County Antrim in Northern Ireland has been baking since she was three, studying for a masters in business. 

141
00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:47.080
When she's not buried under books, she's getting muddy with dogs. 

142
00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:48.680
Miley, Smiley Ruby and Troublesome. 

143
00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:49.120
Tiggy. 

144
00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:50.120
Oh, Tiggy. 

145
00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:57.000
To bring the hazelnut flavor to her coffee cakes, she'll add chopped nuts to both her caramel filling and highly caffeinated sponge. 

146
00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:58.120
Have you practiced this? 

147
00:06:58.320 --> 00:06:58.840
Yeah. 

148
00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:00.800
What did your friends think of it? 

149
00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:03.400
Everyone has different tastes, I'll say that. 

150
00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:06.800
You can get friends anywhere. 

151
00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:08.000
Yeah, exactly. 

152
00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:10.120
This is a massive risk. 

153
00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:13.000
Ribs isn't the only baker adding a kick to their cake. 

154
00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:17.840
Chilli powder is there not to bring in the chilli, but helps bring in the flavours of the chocolate even further. 

155
00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:23.000
A keen dancer, software engineer Abdul likes to Lindy hop with girlfriend Christine. 

156
00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:23.680
Hello. 

157
00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:29.120
Born in Saudi Arabia but now living in London, he's not seen his family for over three years. 

158
00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:29.560
Oh. 

159
00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:31.280
Technical difficulties. 

160
00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:38.960
Containing raspberry jam and mascarpone between layers of chocolate and hazelnut sponge, Abduls sandwich cakes are dedicated to former friends. 

161
00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.720
I'm a huge lover of plants. 

162
00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:42.440
I have tons of them in my house. 

163
00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:43.240
I've killed a lot. 

164
00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:46.200
Unfortunately, I'm trying to make these cakes. 

165
00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:47.560
Pay tribute to those. 

166
00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:50.120
You're my favorite botanical serial killer. 

167
00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:51.800
You always hurt the ones you love. 

168
00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:52.560
Come on. 

169
00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:53.280
Thank you. 

170
00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:56.080
I called this a bite size of love. 

171
00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:58.480
Sandros bakes also come from the heart. 

172
00:07:58.480 --> 00:07:59.680
When I first met my partner. 

173
00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:02.240
Every time we saw each other, I would always give a white rose. 

174
00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:04.240
So I'm making, like, chocolate flower pots. 

175
00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:09.920
When Sandro, a fitness fanatic from East London, isn't hitting the gym, he works as a full time nanny. 

176
00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:13.200
I am the champion. 

177
00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:20.320
He'll fill his flower pots with a chocolate and orange sponge and a rich red wine ganache, from which delicate sugar roses will grow. 

178
00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:21.200
Are you a gym guy? 

179
00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:22.280
You look like you. 

180
00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:23.280
Are twice a day. 

181
00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:24.520
Once is not enough. 

182
00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:26.400
I do know because I'll do like weights. 

183
00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:27.560
And then I'll do cardio. 

184
00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:28.200
Same. 

185
00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:28.960
Can you tell? 

186
00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:32.560
I do weights in a graveyard. 

187
00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:33.840
The old bones. 

188
00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:34.840
Oh. 

189
00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:35.480
Yeah. 

190
00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:36.400
Forget cardio. 

191
00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:37.560
I haven't got a heart. 

192
00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:38.080
Yeah. 

193
00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:40.880
And it seems love is in the air. 

194
00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:43.480
These are many Persian love cakes. 

195
00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:49.360
We've got a large Persian community in our church, so it's a tribute to their faith and their friendship. 

196
00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:53.800
Kevin lives in Lanarkshire, Scotland with his wife Rachel and their dog Judy. 

197
00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:59.840
A talented musician, he not only plays the clarinet, flute and saxophone professionally, but he teaches too. 

198
00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:01.360
Nice one. 

199
00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:08.520
Kevin's love cakes are full of Persian flavour, with rose Swiss meringue buttercream sandwiched between layers of pistachio, almond and cardamom. 

200
00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:09.160
Sponge. 

201
00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:13.760
The sponge is going to have blitzed pistachio nuts, but I'm not going to blitz them right down. 

202
00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:16.400
I still want them to be a bit of texture and a bit of crunch. 

203
00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:21.280
I'm using 120g of pistachios. 

204
00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:24.760
May Sams also chosen to go all out with her nutty sponge. 

205
00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:29.440
I want to get as much flavour and texture in the cake as possible. 

206
00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:37.920
Born in Libya, this year's youngest baker, 18 year old design student, Mason lives in Manchester with her parents, two brothers and younger sister, Juri. 

207
00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:39.600
I'm going to copy your drawing. 

208
00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:40.320
What? 

209
00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:44.240
To help balance the sweetness of her pistachio packed sponge. 

210
00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:48.880
Mason will fill her sandwich cakes with raspberry jam and raspberry Swiss meringue buttercream. 

211
00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:49.520
In the practice. 

212
00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:53.240
It went really well, so I'm hoping that it'll turn out well this time. 

213
00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:54.200
You're the baby here. 

214
00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:55.120
Did you realize that? 

215
00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:57.840
I'm the youngest one, so pressure is on. 

216
00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.160
Key to creating delicious mini sandwich cakes. 

217
00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:03.600
Heavy on the coffee. 

218
00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:07.800
The judges will expect beautifully flavored soft sponge. 

219
00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:10.600
It's the blue eyed one that scares me. 

220
00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:12.400
It's just super intense. 

221
00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:14.040
It's like he's looking through my soul. 

222
00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:15.120
So disapprove. 

223
00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:16.480
And he looks at you like, ah! 

224
00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:18.800
I nearly forgot to put my eggs in. 

225
00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:20.680
Oh my goodness. 

226
00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:22.760
It's like something's missing here. 

227
00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:31.320
Swedish born Maxy, an architectural assistant from south east London, is passing on her passion for baking to daughters Tyra and Talia. 

228
00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:32.720
Okay, that's enough now. 

229
00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:40.760
She's giving her Eton Mess inspired cakes a tropical twist with mango and passion fruit coulis and mascarpone between layers of vanilla sponge. 

230
00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:43.120
You're from Sweden, but I can't hear the accent. 

231
00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:44.880
I've lived here for 21 years. 

232
00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:46.000
You speak. 

233
00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:46.680
Swedish as. 

234
00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:46.880
Well? 

235
00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:47.720
I do speak Swedish. 

236
00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:48.080
Are you? 

237
00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:49.440
I'm semi bilingual. 

238
00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:49.680
Oh. 

239
00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:50.120
Are you? 

240
00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:50.560
Mhm. 

241
00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:52.320
What languages do you speak? 

242
00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:52.840
English? 

243
00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:53.320
English. 

244
00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:53.680
And. 

245
00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:55.400
Well. 

246
00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:56.160
No I'm semi. 

247
00:10:56.680 --> 00:10:57.320
Oh semi. 

248
00:10:57.360 --> 00:10:57.880
Oh yeah. 

249
00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:02.400
Next time I've got a joke I'll put it in writing and send it to you in advance. 

250
00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:03.000
All right. 

251
00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:03.440
Ah. 

252
00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:04.320
Looks good. 

253
00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:05.480
It is going in. 

254
00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:09.480
The quicker the sponges hit the oven, the longer they'll have to cool. 

255
00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:10.800
11 minutes. 

256
00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:11.800
At 180. 

257
00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:13.240
Is there a time on this thing? 

258
00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:20.160
If the bakers attempt to cut and fill their layers of sponge while still warm, they'll be left with a crumbly, leaking mess. 

259
00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:21.040
Ah, crap. 

260
00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:23.720
I forgot to switch it on. 

261
00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:25.280
Sorry, it's not done yet. 

262
00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:27.760
I can tell by visual clues, i.e. 

263
00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:28.680
it's not brown. 

264
00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:36.240
Will is a charity director who lives in London with wife Alison and their three children Max, Verity and Louis. 

265
00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:37.160
That's going well. 

266
00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:37.560
Louis. 

267
00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:39.480
It's quite crumbly. 

268
00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:48.680
To cut through the sweetness of a salty, caramel swirled buttercream, and in a bid to stand out from the crowd, Wills cakes contain no less than three different types of ginger. 

269
00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:49.560
Who do you think is good? 

270
00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:50.840
Who are you scared of? 

271
00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:52.480
Uh, everybody. 

272
00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:55.240
I feel like the first one. 

273
00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:56.600
You're just finding your feet, aren't you? 

274
00:11:56.640 --> 00:11:59.160
New equipment, Paul, leering down on you. 

275
00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:00.480
It's not usually what happens, is it? 

276
00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:00.920
When you're at. 

277
00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:01.120
Home? 

278
00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:01.600
Basically. 

279
00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:03.120
Normally you just sit at home. 

280
00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:07.160
You haven't got a sort of tipsy posh woman and a bronze man staring at you. 

281
00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:08.560
You don't know where I live, do you? 

282
00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:19.400
All right, guys, I know you're new here, so basically, the way things work in this tent, if you want to know how long you got left, you have to give us each a fiver. 

283
00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:22.560
Oh, well, it was worth a try. 

284
00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:23.680
You've got an hour left. 

285
00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:24.920
An hour? 

286
00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:26.000
Is that good or bad? 

287
00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:26.920
It's bad for me. 

288
00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:30.680
I'm not feeling confident about my meringues cos these have to go in for an hour. 

289
00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:33.560
Oh, that's the timer for my cakes. 

290
00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:36.000
Ooh, they have risen very well. 

291
00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:37.160
More than I thought. 

292
00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:40.280
The difference between perfectly baked, moist sponge. 

293
00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:40.720
Oh. 

294
00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:41.280
It's done. 

295
00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:43.440
And a dry, dense disaster. 

296
00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:44.280
Oh, my. 

297
00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:46.600
Can be a matter of moments. 

298
00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:47.560
It should be cooked. 

299
00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:49.000
You get the absolute fear. 

300
00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:51.640
These are sticky toffee pudding sponges. 

301
00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:53.680
Bit alarmed at one edge have sunk. 

302
00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:56.160
Don't know how that happened, but I think it's okay. 

303
00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:57.920
It's like the famous last words, isn't it? 

304
00:12:57.960 --> 00:13:03.440
Originally from Glasgow, James, a nuclear scientist, has been baking since he was five years old. 

305
00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:06.880
It's a passion matched only by his love of 80s horror films. 

306
00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:07.800
That's incredible. 

307
00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:15.400
He'll add warmth to his sticky toffee apple sandwich cakes with ginger in his apple jam and nutmeg in his buttercream. 

308
00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:16.920
Explain the colour of the kilt then. 

309
00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:17.840
Is it family? 

310
00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:19.800
So it's actually the kilt I wore for my graduation. 

311
00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:20.440
Pants or no. 

312
00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:20.880
Pants? 

313
00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:22.920
Yeah, that's for you to find out, isn't it? 

314
00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:25.240
That's an invitation. 

315
00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:28.240
While there, sponge is cool. 

316
00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:30.200
I have a wee apple jam going. 

317
00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:32.520
The bakers turn their attention to fillings. 

318
00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:34.080
This is hazelnut caramel. 

319
00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:36.400
But I'm a wee bit concerned because it's a bit runny. 

320
00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:38.040
I probably put too much butter in. 

321
00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:41.080
I'm making Italian meringue buttercream. 

322
00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:43.480
They're technically complicated version of buttercream. 

323
00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:47.600
But Will's not the only one trying to impress with his ambitious icing. 

324
00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:49.640
Struggling to cut this butter. 

325
00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:51.720
The buttercream is flavoured with rose. 

326
00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:56.520
I know that rose can be a really overpowering flavour, so it's just a whisper. 

327
00:13:57.680 --> 00:14:01.280
While Will, Mason and Kevin attempt to sweeten up the judges. 

328
00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:05.000
Nice dozy doats and dozy doats. 

329
00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:08.280
Carol's gone sour. 

330
00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:09.560
Just make me lemon curd. 

331
00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:12.680
I don't put that much sugar in because I want it nice and tart. 

332
00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:14.520
West country born and bred. 

333
00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:18.440
Carol, a supermarket cashier, lives in Dorset with husband Michael. 

334
00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:19.720
A keen gardener. 

335
00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:22.240
She's affectionately known as compost Carol. 

336
00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:23.840
Yeah, a nice bit of root. 

337
00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:25.840
As well as her curd filling. 

338
00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:30.120
She'll add lemon juice to her buttercream and zest to her lemon and poppy seed sponge. 

339
00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:32.040
I'm a little bit of a classic bakery. 

340
00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:35.040
The carrot cakes and your lemon drizzles. 

341
00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:38.800
I'm not a big one for putting exotic ingredients in, you know. 

342
00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:42.360
But somewhere exotic is exactly where Dawn's heading. 

343
00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:45.360
I'm doing lime and tamarind spring cake. 

344
00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:46.040
Tamarind. 

345
00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:50.560
It's a slightly earthy flavour, but it's fruity at the same time. 

346
00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:54.400
And this bake, it's fairly traditional, but it's got a bit of a twist. 

347
00:14:54.440 --> 00:15:03.080
Dawn, a former project manager for Boris Johnson, lives in Bedfordshire, where she entertains granddaughter Emmie with her hand-modeled sugar figurines. 

348
00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:03.640
Mr. 

349
00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:05.640
Eggington, do you like him? 

350
00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:06.520
Yes. 

351
00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:13.720
To complement her tamarind jelly filling, she'll add coconut to her sponge and create a coconut marzipan topping. 

352
00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:15.160
You worked for Boris Johnson? 

353
00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:16.240
Not directly. 

354
00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:17.520
Did you get to meet him? 

355
00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:17.920
Yeah. 

356
00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:19.600
His hair was a bit like yours. 

357
00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:21.240
I know, wasn't it? 

358
00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:22.040
Yeah. 

359
00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:23.760
And his face was a bit like mine. 

360
00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:24.080
Yeah. 

361
00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:24.400
There you go. 

362
00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:25.600
We're like a hybrid. 

363
00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:26.920
Well. 

364
00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:29.960
Put us together and you have Boris Johnson. 

365
00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:30.600
How about that? 

366
00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:31.160
Yeah. 

367
00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:35.440
Dawn isn't the only baker bringing a taste of the tropics. 

368
00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:40.400
I am making Malaysian cake, which is based on pandan flavouring. 

369
00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:41.760
It is very aromatic. 

370
00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:43.760
People call it Asian vanilla. 

371
00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:48.600
Malaysian born Kabira lives in London, where she works in cardiovascular research. 

372
00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:50.640
Comes after a hard day in the lab. 

373
00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:53.680
She likes to relax gaming online with boyfriend Bradley. 

374
00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:55.120
Oh, headshot. 

375
00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:56.360
Oh, I got Headshotted. 

376
00:15:57.480 --> 00:16:03.840
Kabira will flavor her sponge and coconut custard with pandan and add caramel to both her mousse and decorations. 

377
00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:06.760
Traditional Malaysian sweets known as ondeh ondeh. 

378
00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:09.080
I'm going to make a caramel bomb. 

379
00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:12.400
When you bite into it, the caramel just bursts out. 

380
00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:14.320
You're gonna blow the judges heads off. 

381
00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:15.240
I love. 

382
00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:15.600
This. 

383
00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:16.320
Good luck, good luck. 

384
00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:17.360
This sounds amazing. 

385
00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:17.880
Thank you. 

386
00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:21.600
Anyone who tries to bomb these two is amazing in my book. 

387
00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:27.160
But Shabir, as caramel bombs aren't the only bake that should probably come with a safety warning. 

388
00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:30.160
I'm soaking my sponges with Polish cherry liqueur. 

389
00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:33.960
What I'm making today will be a Polish inspired bake which is vietka. 

390
00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:38.720
Janusz is a PA from Brighton, where he lives with boyfriend Simon and sausage dog Nigel. 

391
00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:44.000
He learned many of his Polish recipes from mum Elisha, who taught him and his sister to bake. 

392
00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:50.680
Filled with pistachio cream and cherries. 

393
00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:54.480
Hilltop his boozy zitka with a layer of rich chocolate ganache. 

394
00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:56.640
It's like a Polish black forest. 

395
00:16:56.880 --> 00:16:58.920
That's cherries soaked in booze. 

396
00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:00.000
Thinking of you. 

397
00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:01.040
Good. 

398
00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:01.880
Thank you. 

399
00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:02.840
You've done your homework. 

400
00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:03.840
I am glad to hear this. 

401
00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:05.280
Sounds absolutely delicious. 

402
00:17:05.320 --> 00:17:06.360
This is my kind of bike. 

403
00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:07.520
Good luck, good luck. 

404
00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:09.600
I want to do the time. 

405
00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:10.000
It's my. 

406
00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:10.200
Turn. 

407
00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:10.920
No, it's my turn. 

408
00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:11.840
Let me do the time. 

409
00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:12.720
I'm doing the time. 

410
00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:13.000
Call. 

411
00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:13.400
All right. 

412
00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:13.720
Fine. 

413
00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:14.880
You do the time call. 

414
00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:17.200
Bakers, you have half an hour left. 

415
00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:17.640
Ooh. 

416
00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:19.560
This sponge is done. 

417
00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:22.840
But my Italian meringue split for reasons I don't understand. 

418
00:17:22.840 --> 00:17:24.000
So I'm going to make it again. 

419
00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:28.360
But Italian meringue buttercream takes half an hour, so it's slightly worrying. 

420
00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:31.920
I'm about to start cutting out the cakes. 

421
00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:34.720
No matter whether they've baked large trays of sponge. 

422
00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:37.200
I'm just going to make small circles. 

423
00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:38.720
Or individual portions. 

424
00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:43.880
The judges will expect every slice of the bakers sandwich cakes to be uniform and neat. 

425
00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:45.080
The tubs will be cut off. 

426
00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:47.600
They all will be even size ruler. 

427
00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:51.240
I mean, most people wouldn't care, but the judges aren't most people. 

428
00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:54.760
The perfect slices. 

429
00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:57.600
It's very soft cake, so I need to be careful. 

430
00:17:57.600 --> 00:17:59.600
Require a cool sponge. 

431
00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:02.080
Oh, it's gone all crumbly. 

432
00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:05.720
I think I cut them whilst it was still a bit warm. 

433
00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:12.680
Now they're gonna need plenty of cherry vodka. 

434
00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:14.320
I've got my big guns here. 

435
00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:18.160
Drizzle some more pandan flavorings. 

436
00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:20.800
Oh my God. 

437
00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:24.800
Hopefully, with the help of buttercream, I managed to hide it. 

438
00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:24.840
did. 

439
00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:27.880
But there's a flaw in Mason's plan. 

440
00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:29.400
The buttercream has curdled. 

441
00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:30.440
Yeah. 

442
00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:33.760
It'll take some time to fix it. 

443
00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:36.960
How long have we got left? 

444
00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:39.720
Bakers, you have 15 minutes left. 

445
00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:40.360
Oh. 

446
00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:41.680
15 minutes. 

447
00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:43.440
Oh, my gosh, I'm gonna start assembling. 

448
00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:44.080
You'll make it. 

449
00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:44.760
We have to. 

450
00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:48.280
Ah! This caramel is starting to melt. 

451
00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:50.560
At home, I wouldn't care if the caramel was over the edge. 

452
00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:51.240
And now you're like. 

453
00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:51.640
Ah! 

454
00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:53.000
Now custard. 

455
00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:55.040
This is red wine ganache. 

456
00:18:55.120 --> 00:18:55.400
Proper. 

457
00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:55.840
Strong. 

458
00:18:56.200 --> 00:18:59.040
Finally seeing some Swiss meringue buttercream. 

459
00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:02.920
While Mason's filling comes together at last. 

460
00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:04.160
That was a nightmare. 

461
00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:05.320
A nightmare. 

462
00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:06.080
Pulled it off. 

463
00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:08.320
It's done it again. 

464
00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:09.760
For the second time. 

465
00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:13.920
Wills has split. 

466
00:19:13.960 --> 00:19:14.320
Ah! 

467
00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:16.480
I need to make buttercream. 

468
00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:18.360
How do I make buttercream? 

469
00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:20.000
Butter. 

470
00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:21.120
Sugar? 

471
00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:21.600
Yeah. 

472
00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:22.160
Yeah. 

473
00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:27.320
Decoration time making these fiddly little buggers. 

474
00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:29.880
So I'm just making the caramel for the wee candles. 

475
00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:32.320
You're a nuclear scientist, is that right? 

476
00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:32.600
Yeah. 

477
00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:34.560
This is a bit of a comedown for you, isn't it? 

478
00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:35.120
I mean. 

479
00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:36.880
Haven't you got more important things to be doing? 

480
00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:38.800
Making cakes is vastly more exciting. 

481
00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:40.560
These are cacao nibs. 

482
00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:41.560
It's the soil. 

483
00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:43.320
Hello, petal. 

484
00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:43.640
Hello. 

485
00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:44.000
Hello. 

486
00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:45.120
I was talking to the. 

487
00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:50.800
Bakers, you have five minutes left. 

488
00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:52.480
Tight, tight tight, tight. 

489
00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:52.920
Get going. 

490
00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:53.760
I gotta get going. 

491
00:19:53.800 --> 00:19:55.120
Gotta decorate the top. 

492
00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:56.400
Add my fruits on. 

493
00:19:56.440 --> 00:19:57.160
Terrified. 

494
00:19:57.200 --> 00:19:58.760
Start away and get this done on time. 

495
00:19:58.840 --> 00:19:59.760
It's looking rubbish. 

496
00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:00.960
Think, William. 

497
00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:02.680
Calm yourself down, mate. 

498
00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:04.920
I feel like I shouldn't be this calm. 

499
00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:06.840
I just wonder what's gone wrong. 

500
00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:11.960
I'm just very carefully trying to put the coconut topping on. 

501
00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:15.160
I kind of wish the buttercream was a tiny bit better. 

502
00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:16.320
Oh, this is not good. 

503
00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:17.880
They're just sliding. 

504
00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:19.760
What a frigging nightmare. 

505
00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:20.880
Finishing touches. 

506
00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:24.520
Flavor wise should be good, but look wise. 

507
00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:26.680
100% not happy with it. 

508
00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:30.440
It's not perfect, but I do like it, I don't know. 

509
00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:31.640
These look amazing. 

510
00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:33.120
This is your Persian business, right? 

511
00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:33.440
Yes. 

512
00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:34.480
Have you been to Persia? 

513
00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:35.520
Uh, no. 

514
00:20:35.560 --> 00:20:36.320
Maybe one day. 

515
00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:37.520
We'll go together. 

516
00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:38.480
Yeah. 

517
00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:38.920
Yeah. 

518
00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:40.520
Are you free on the 14th? 

519
00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:42.040
14th of what I've got. 

520
00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:43.080
I've got to do a time call. 

521
00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:43.600
Goodbye. 

522
00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:46.360
Bakers, you have one minute left. 

523
00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:48.600
Oh my God. 

524
00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:49.600
60s. 

525
00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:50.920
Kids, you can do this. 

526
00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:53.400
I'm gonna try as many cactuses as possible. 

527
00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:55.600
A very rushed nutmeg job. 

528
00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:58.880
I'm just trying to do whatever I can do right now. 

529
00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:01.080
Don't collapse. 

530
00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:06.200
Bakers. 

531
00:21:06.440 --> 00:21:07.000
No. 

532
00:21:07.080 --> 00:21:08.880
Your time is up. 

533
00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:10.160
Oh. 

534
00:21:11.080 --> 00:21:14.960
Please step away from your mini sandwich cakes. 

535
00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:16.000
Well done, well done. 

536
00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:17.040
High ten. 

537
00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:18.520
That was a good high ten as well. 

538
00:21:18.560 --> 00:21:20.040
There's Margaret, there's many. 

539
00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:20.920
There's Maureen. 

540
00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:22.760
That's so cute. 

541
00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:24.720
Look at. 

542
00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:25.280
This. 

543
00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:28.040
Janusz, those are so neat. 

544
00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:29.320
It's rubbish. 

545
00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:30.000
Uh. 

546
00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:38.200
For the very first time, our 12 new bakers and their mini sandwich cakes are about to face the judgment of Paul and Prue. 

547
00:22:38.480 --> 00:22:39.240
Hello, Maxie. 

548
00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:39.800
Hiya. 

549
00:22:40.280 --> 00:22:43.640
In your world, mini is a curious thing. 

550
00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:44.920
That's huge. 

551
00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:49.920
Let's have a look at these monsters. 

552
00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:51.200
You've got it all over your fingers. 

553
00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:52.560
I can't take them anywhere. 

554
00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:54.600
You know, I've got mess in the title, so. 

555
00:22:54.840 --> 00:22:55.200
Yeah. 

556
00:22:55.320 --> 00:22:56.320
Yeah, exactly. 

557
00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:01.160
The cake's quite dry. 

558
00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:02.160
Is it dry? 

559
00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:04.920
You probably could have done with slightly less bake on that. 

560
00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:05.320
Yeah. 

561
00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:09.160
However, there's nothing wrong with passion fruit sponge and a meringue. 

562
00:23:09.320 --> 00:23:11.480
The combination of flavours is beautiful. 

563
00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:12.840
Well done, well done. 

564
00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:13.600
Thank you, thank you, 

565
00:23:15.040 --> 00:23:15.520
thank you. 

566
00:23:15.920 --> 00:23:17.280
Oh my goodness. 

567
00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:23.400
The pipework. 

568
00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:24.480
That's just like a blob. 

569
00:23:24.520 --> 00:23:25.320
What is that? 

570
00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:26.360
Who knows at this point? 

571
00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:28.400
That taste is like. 

572
00:23:30.280 --> 00:23:30.600
Mm. 

573
00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:31.880
Beautiful. 

574
00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:34.280
Absolutely sticky toffee pudding. 

575
00:23:34.280 --> 00:23:36.320
But better because it's got ginger. 

576
00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:40.160
So we figured out you can bake, but you need to concentrate on some of the detail. 

577
00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:43.160
I think they look great. 

578
00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:44.600
Love the decoration on the top. 

579
00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:45.360
So cute. 

580
00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:46.840
And I love the colors. 

581
00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:52.240
They're absolutely classic flavors. 

582
00:23:52.280 --> 00:23:53.360
Nicely balanced. 

583
00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:54.200
Yeah. 

584
00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:57.720
There's enough lemon in there because you're getting it through the curd as well, which is nice and sharp. 

585
00:23:57.760 --> 00:23:58.720
What's not to like? 

586
00:23:59.120 --> 00:23:59.640
Thank you. 

587
00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:03.600
They look very good. 

588
00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:05.120
Pretty consistent. 

589
00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:11.160
The rose is perfect. 

590
00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:15.400
The cake itself is a bit heavy. 

591
00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:18.800
You've got too much in there which will pull all the moisture from the cake. 

592
00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:20.400
So it's very, very dry. 

593
00:24:20.680 --> 00:24:21.120
Okay. 

594
00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:26.400
They don't look wonderful, do they? 

595
00:24:26.520 --> 00:24:27.800
No, they're falling apart. 

596
00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:31.640
I cut it whilst it was still warm inside. Fatal crumbling a bit. 

597
00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:38.080
The sponge is delicious and the Swiss meringue is lovely. 

598
00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:38.960
Could it have been sharper? 

599
00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:40.360
Could have had more raspberry in there. 

600
00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:42.960
I don't think there's anything wrong with the flavours. 

601
00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:44.000
It just looks a mess. 

602
00:24:47.320 --> 00:24:48.240
They do look amazing. 

603
00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:49.040
I love the colour. 

604
00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:49.680
I love the pot. 

605
00:24:49.720 --> 00:24:50.720
I love the soil. 

606
00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:53.320
I just hope inside tastes as good as it looks. 

607
00:24:54.640 --> 00:24:57.160
I mean, that is really clever to get all that in there. 

608
00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:02.840
The flavours are really punchy. 

609
00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:06.440
The red wine ganache works beautifully well with the raspberry. 

610
00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:08.400
Oh, it's rich and indulgent. 

611
00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:09.120
Well done. 

612
00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:09.680
Thank you. 

613
00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:15.920
At first glance, you think absolutely delightful. 

614
00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:18.520
If you look closely, there are a few problems on there. 

615
00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:19.400
They're a bit wibbly. 

616
00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:24.520
The timing works really well. 

617
00:25:24.560 --> 00:25:26.320
Coconut works beautifully well with it. 

618
00:25:26.360 --> 00:25:28.120
Overall, it's a really nice cake. 

619
00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:29.280
And it's original. 

620
00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:29.600
Good. 

621
00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:30.160
Well done. 

622
00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:30.920
Thank you. 

623
00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:31.120
Yeah. 

624
00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:31.600
Nice one. 

625
00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:37.360
Abdul, I think it looks absolutely delicious. 

626
00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:37.960
Thank you. 

627
00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:39.840
It's almost an illusion, which I quite like. 

628
00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:41.160
It does look like a garden. 

629
00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:47.120
Mm. 

630
00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:48.800
It's very light. 

631
00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:50.040
A little kick of chilli. 

632
00:25:50.040 --> 00:25:51.560
You get a little acidity. 

633
00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:54.320
I think the raspberry in there is a beautiful flavour. 

634
00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:55.960
I love the hazelnut as well. 

635
00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:56.440
Thank you. 

636
00:25:56.480 --> 00:25:57.320
I'm impressed. 

637
00:25:57.360 --> 00:25:57.680
Thank you. 

638
00:25:57.720 --> 00:25:58.040
Abdul. 

639
00:25:58.080 --> 00:25:58.520
Lovely. 

640
00:25:58.920 --> 00:25:59.360
Well done. 

641
00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:01.360
That went better than I thought, actually. 

642
00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:01.960
Well done. 

643
00:26:02.280 --> 00:26:02.800
Thank you. 

644
00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:06.320
They could be neater. 

645
00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:06.760
Yes. 

646
00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:07.920
Love the colours, though. 

647
00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:09.400
They're vibrant and in your face. 

648
00:26:15.560 --> 00:26:16.600
Get the flavors in there. 

649
00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:19.960
Coming from the panda and the caramel and the coconut is delicious. 

650
00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:21.320
It's such an interesting thing to do. 

651
00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:23.120
A set custard on top of a cake. 

652
00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:24.320
Gooey and unctuous. 

653
00:26:24.360 --> 00:26:25.120
And not too sweet. 

654
00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:25.920
Yeah, okay. 

655
00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:26.400
It's bomb. 

656
00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:26.680
Time. 

657
00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:27.760
Can I nick a sugar bomb? 

658
00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:28.240
Yes. 

659
00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:28.920
Feel free. 

660
00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:30.520
That's amazing. 

661
00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:31.600
It's not too sweet. 

662
00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:33.120
Actually, I was expecting it to be. 

663
00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:34.440
But you do get the burst of sugar. 

664
00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:34.800
Look at me. 

665
00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:36.320
I'll have you two out of a job here. 

666
00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:38.200
Thank you very much. 

667
00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:38.760
Thank you. 

668
00:26:39.320 --> 00:26:40.200
I liked it. 

669
00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:42.600
I mean, that counts for nothing, but I liked it. 

670
00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:48.800
It looks like your caramel was a bit runny. 

671
00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:51.480
Did you mean the caramel to run down the sides? 

672
00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:52.240
No. 

673
00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:54.200
I spent ages trying to get the caramel perfect. 

674
00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:55.000
And then it went. 

675
00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:01.800
It was enough coffee in there to keep you awake at night. 

676
00:27:04.520 --> 00:27:04.840
Mhm. 

677
00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:08.800
The other flavours are coming through, are not strong enough to compete with it. 

678
00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:10.280
And the ganache is too hard. 

679
00:27:10.520 --> 00:27:11.280
You're neat enough. 

680
00:27:11.280 --> 00:27:12.000
I can see that. 

681
00:27:12.040 --> 00:27:14.000
Just be careful about your flavors. 

682
00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:20.920
It's a bit messy. 

683
00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:23.520
My buttercream didn't go to plan twice. 

684
00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:24.760
The curse of the tent. 

685
00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:26.080
The curse of the tent. 

686
00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:29.800
Feel the heart rate going up. Yeah. 

687
00:27:31.560 --> 00:27:33.920
Well, I think it's a bit 

688
00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:35.880
disappointing. 

689
00:27:36.520 --> 00:27:37.760
It's a bit bland. 

690
00:27:37.800 --> 00:27:39.160
There's ginger, but not enough. 

691
00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:43.080
There's a caramel undertone, but it's got no hero in there, which is what you need. 

692
00:27:43.120 --> 00:27:44.000
Besides that. 

693
00:27:44.320 --> 00:27:44.920
Brilliant. 

694
00:27:46.360 --> 00:27:46.800
Never mind. 

695
00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:47.120
Will. 

696
00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:53.920
That looks amazing. 

697
00:27:53.960 --> 00:27:55.400
It's neat as a pin. 

698
00:27:55.440 --> 00:27:56.880
Just has to taste good now. 

699
00:27:58.320 --> 00:27:59.240
Oh it's lovely. 

700
00:27:59.280 --> 00:27:59.880
Sponge. 

701
00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:00.960
Very light. 

702
00:28:04.520 --> 00:28:05.360
And boozy. 

703
00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:07.160
Yes, that's how I like them. 

704
00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:08.520
For me, that's perfect. 

705
00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:09.920
It is very boozy. 

706
00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:12.360
I think you've got too much booze. 

707
00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:14.600
That's the overwhelming flavour. 

708
00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:16.240
Texturally, it's perfect. 

709
00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:17.000
It really is. 

710
00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:18.440
It's got a problem here, isn't it? 

711
00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:20.120
Because I think booze is perfect. 

712
00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:22.400
Well done. 

713
00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:23.120
Thank you very much. 

714
00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:23.600
Thank you. 

715
00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:25.400
They're now stumbling. 

716
00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:25.680
Back. 

717
00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:27.640
Out of the tent. 

718
00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:30.000
I'm happy that it went well. 

719
00:28:30.280 --> 00:28:34.600
There was a lot of booze in my cake because even when I'm eating it, I'm thinking that's wrong. 

720
00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:36.000
They like it. 

721
00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:37.480
They like my ondeh ondeh. 

722
00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:40.360
It is very nice when people say your food is good. 

723
00:28:41.480 --> 00:28:46.080
It's interesting to have a disaster in your first challenge. 

724
00:28:46.200 --> 00:28:47.760
Not my finest moment. 

725
00:28:48.040 --> 00:28:49.480
I think it's fair to say. 

726
00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:56.640
Each week, the bakers will face a mystery. 

727
00:28:56.680 --> 00:28:58.960
Second challenge veiled by gingham. 

728
00:28:59.280 --> 00:29:00.160
Hello, bakers. 

729
00:29:00.160 --> 00:29:01.240
Welcome back to the tent. 

730
00:29:01.240 --> 00:29:04.400
It's time for your first ever technical challenge. 

731
00:29:04.760 --> 00:29:08.680
And your technical challenge today has been set for you by baby Paul. 

732
00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:09.240
Oh. 

733
00:29:09.560 --> 00:29:09.920
Paul. 

734
00:29:10.160 --> 00:29:11.400
Any words of advice? 

735
00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:12.480
It's a classic. 

736
00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:14.920
Concentrate on your sponge. 

737
00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:17.320
Well, as ever, this task is judged blind. 

738
00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:23.280
So we ask Paul and Prue to leave the tent where they are going to be cryogenically frozen. 

739
00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:25.000
Wrap up warm kids. 

740
00:29:26.120 --> 00:29:30.640
So Paul would like you to produce a red velvet cake. 

741
00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:31.120
Oh. 

742
00:29:31.520 --> 00:29:37.200
Your All-American layered cake should make a big impression on both the eyes and the palate. 

743
00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:39.440
I love impressions, Matt's good at impressions. 

744
00:29:39.480 --> 00:29:39.720
Fact. 

745
00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:41.680
He does an amazing Paul. God. 

746
00:29:41.720 --> 00:29:42.000
Do you? 

747
00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:42.400
Paul. 

748
00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:43.920
You're a good baker. 

749
00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:45.240
You're a good baker. 

750
00:29:45.280 --> 00:29:46.880
You're a good baker, too. 

751
00:29:46.920 --> 00:29:47.800
All right. 

752
00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:52.880
I mean, if you cover your eyes, it's like he's back in the tent. 

753
00:29:52.920 --> 00:29:53.560
Uncanny. 

754
00:29:53.600 --> 00:30:02.400
Your classic cake should consist of six tender, moist, crimson red sponges sandwiching a smooth, fluffy cream cheese icing. 

755
00:30:02.480 --> 00:30:05.840
Sprinkled with red crumbs to give it that red velvet finish. 

756
00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:09.360
You have two hours until we defrost Paul and Prue. 

757
00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:10.240
On your marks. 

758
00:30:10.280 --> 00:30:11.120
Get set. 

759
00:30:11.160 --> 00:30:11.680
Bake. 

760
00:30:16.280 --> 00:30:20.320
Obviously, my first challenge was a disaster, so I'm stressed. 

761
00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:22.000
It's like anxiety. 

762
00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:24.480
In the technical challenge. 

763
00:30:24.480 --> 00:30:27.360
The bakers are all given the same basic recipe. 

764
00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:30.480
This is very sentimental. 

765
00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:33.280
This is the first cake I ever made. 

766
00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:36.280
I normally do a red velvet cake, but that's the curse in it. 

767
00:30:36.280 --> 00:30:37.480
You're like, yeah, I know how to do that. 

768
00:30:37.480 --> 00:30:39.480
And then this is the one that you don't. 

769
00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:42.200
I've never made one before. 

770
00:30:43.680 --> 00:30:44.120
Paul. 

771
00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:46.440
Red velvet cake for our first technical. 

772
00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:47.720
Why have you gone for that? 

773
00:30:47.720 --> 00:30:49.560
The advantage is everybody will know it. 

774
00:30:49.560 --> 00:30:55.600
It's quite a light, chocolatey cake with the use of vinegar and buttermilk blended with bicarb. 

775
00:30:55.640 --> 00:30:57.000
There's your raisin agent. 

776
00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:59.040
And actually, there's the flavour. 

777
00:30:59.040 --> 00:31:01.400
It has a very distinctive tang to it. 

778
00:31:01.480 --> 00:31:05.360
Obviously there's coloring to give it that beautiful, vibrant red inside. 

779
00:31:05.360 --> 00:31:05.800
Wow. 

780
00:31:06.080 --> 00:31:08.680
We haven't told the bakers how much food coloring. 

781
00:31:08.920 --> 00:31:11.320
Adding too much will make the cake far too dark. 

782
00:31:11.320 --> 00:31:15.240
And the proportion of cream cheese is much higher than you'd have in most sponges. 

783
00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:16.880
Yeah, it's a big cake. 

784
00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:18.320
We want height. 

785
00:31:18.360 --> 00:31:21.080
So the thickness of cream cheese is critical. 

786
00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:21.880
It's lovely. 

787
00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:23.840
I can't wait to see what they're going to turn out like. 

788
00:31:23.840 --> 00:31:28.560
What I'm not looking forward to is trying 12 red velvet cakes. 

789
00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:30.520
You're gonna have to stretch me out of there. 

790
00:31:31.640 --> 00:31:34.200
The first instruction is make the red velvet batter. 

791
00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:36.280
No hints as to how good. 

792
00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:37.240
What do we. 

793
00:31:37.240 --> 00:31:37.440
Do? 

794
00:31:37.480 --> 00:31:39.040
Luckily, I've got it all in here. 

795
00:31:39.160 --> 00:31:41.480
I'm mixing my butter and sugar. 

796
00:31:41.960 --> 00:31:42.720
Screaming up. 

797
00:31:42.720 --> 00:31:43.800
That's what I want. 

798
00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:47.640
Now I'm gonna add the eggs, the buttermilk, flour, cocoa and vinegar. 

799
00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:49.160
Why are you putting vinegar in it? 

800
00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:50.200
Like, what's that about? 

801
00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:51.760
Why would you ever put vinegar in a cake? 

802
00:31:51.800 --> 00:31:53.440
It's a bit of a chemical reaction. 

803
00:31:53.800 --> 00:31:55.320
Like Diana Ross sang that. 

804
00:31:55.360 --> 00:32:01.640
Combining vinegar, buttermilk and bicarbonate of soda creates the bubbles crucial to producing a light sponge. 

805
00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:03.200
So I'll chuck in a bunch now. 

806
00:32:03.520 --> 00:32:05.600
But timing is everything. 

807
00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:10.440
You've got to add the bicarb just before you put it in the oven, because it doesn't last very long. 

808
00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:12.160
I'm just going to wing it. 

809
00:32:12.200 --> 00:32:13.680
There's not really a method. 

810
00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:16.040
How red to make it is the question. 

811
00:32:16.040 --> 00:32:18.000
Crimson was the directive. 

812
00:32:18.040 --> 00:32:19.480
What is crimson mean? 

813
00:32:19.520 --> 00:32:20.160
Does it mean 

814
00:32:21.440 --> 00:32:22.280
light red? 

815
00:32:22.320 --> 00:32:23.640
Hers is a bit redder than yours. 

816
00:32:23.680 --> 00:32:24.640
Look, this is true. 

817
00:32:24.680 --> 00:32:25.520
You could add a bit more. 

818
00:32:25.560 --> 00:32:26.680
I mean, I don't ask me. 

819
00:32:26.680 --> 00:32:28.280
I've got no clue what I'm doing. 

820
00:32:28.840 --> 00:32:29.840
But then I'll blame you. 

821
00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:31.160
I won't care. 

822
00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:31.480
You know. 

823
00:32:31.520 --> 00:32:31.840
That. 

824
00:32:32.360 --> 00:32:32.880
Right? 

825
00:32:32.920 --> 00:32:33.840
Come on then, babies. 

826
00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:37.480
It just says bake at your leisure, however long you want. 

827
00:32:37.800 --> 00:32:38.680
Ah, sugar. 

828
00:32:38.720 --> 00:32:41.320
Those are being baked for as long as it takes. 

829
00:32:41.560 --> 00:32:42.040
I think. 

830
00:32:42.080 --> 00:32:43.320
25 minutes. 

831
00:32:43.640 --> 00:32:46.840
They're not very big, so I might give them, like 13 minutes, and then I'll see how they're doing. 

832
00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:48.360
What are you. 

833
00:32:48.360 --> 00:32:48.640
Doing? 

834
00:32:48.680 --> 00:32:49.200
Who knows? 

835
00:32:49.320 --> 00:32:51.320
Sort of clattering an adventure. 

836
00:32:52.120 --> 00:32:52.720
I'm just. 

837
00:32:53.640 --> 00:32:54.800
I'm just flinging stuff. 

838
00:32:54.840 --> 00:32:56.840
You've made a red velvet cake before. 

839
00:32:57.080 --> 00:33:01.960
I have, but not for about 30 years when my kids were little. 

840
00:33:01.960 --> 00:33:02.960
I have to go back into. 

841
00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:06.720
The yeah, the trouble is, I was probably under the influence of alcohol. 

842
00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:10.320
For red velvet cake. 

843
00:33:10.360 --> 00:33:12.360
It's very personal for me. 

844
00:33:12.360 --> 00:33:19.920
Before I left Malaysia, my friends, we all sit down together for four of us, having a very nice red velvet cake. 

845
00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:23.200
So I just made the last cake that I had with my friends. 

846
00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:27.000
Without them, I will never discover my hidden talent to bake. 

847
00:33:28.520 --> 00:33:30.400
Bakers, you are halfway through. 

848
00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:36.640
I don't want to put any pressure on you guys, but we're going to take the best red velvet cake with the aid of a sewing machine. 

849
00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:39.280
I'm going to turn it into skimpy briefs for me and Matt. 

850
00:33:39.640 --> 00:33:41.920
If I fail to see why that's funny. 

851
00:33:43.240 --> 00:33:45.040
Make the cream cheese frosting. 

852
00:33:45.040 --> 00:33:45.960
There's no recipe. 

853
00:33:46.440 --> 00:33:47.320
Just making it. 

854
00:33:48.280 --> 00:33:53.080
I'm just gonna mix my cream cheese and mascarpone together, then add the double cream and then whip it. 

855
00:33:53.280 --> 00:33:54.640
It should be fluffy. 

856
00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:54.920
Safe. 

857
00:33:55.080 --> 00:33:55.800
Yeah. 

858
00:33:56.400 --> 00:34:02.560
But the bakers must whip with caution over whip, and their frosting will become a runny mess. 

859
00:34:02.600 --> 00:34:03.520
I didn't get this tick, man. 

860
00:34:03.520 --> 00:34:04.680
Because it's not going to settle. 

861
00:34:05.080 --> 00:34:05.960
Hoo boy. 

862
00:34:06.480 --> 00:34:07.720
That is liquid. 

863
00:34:08.200 --> 00:34:11.560
It's got to be like this where it can lift and it's made it gloss. 

864
00:34:12.640 --> 00:34:13.040
Yeah. 

865
00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:15.240
This is, like, perfect cream cheese here. 

866
00:34:17.640 --> 00:34:18.840
I'm gonna take a little bit longer. 

867
00:34:20.640 --> 00:34:21.680
So it's a waiting game. 

868
00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:24.040
They're taking forever to bake. 

869
00:34:24.120 --> 00:34:25.200
Taking so long. 

870
00:34:25.240 --> 00:34:26.160
It's giving me anxiety. 

871
00:34:26.200 --> 00:34:26.880
Just waiting. 

872
00:34:27.360 --> 00:34:30.480
Kevin, does it annoy you that there's another Scottish person in here? 

873
00:34:30.480 --> 00:34:31.520
Because it annoys me. 

874
00:34:31.520 --> 00:34:32.760
And I'm not even Scottish. 

875
00:34:33.200 --> 00:34:34.960
He's wearing a kilt and kicking it out. 

876
00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:35.480
Scottish to me. 

877
00:34:35.680 --> 00:34:35.960
He has. 

878
00:34:35.960 --> 00:34:37.000
Out scotched you, hasn't. 

879
00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:37.160
He? 

880
00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:37.720
Yeah. 

881
00:34:38.240 --> 00:34:38.840
Do you know him? 

882
00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:40.760
I assume everyone in Scotland knows each other. 

883
00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:42.120
We do come from the same county. 

884
00:34:42.160 --> 00:34:42.400
Yeah. 

885
00:34:42.440 --> 00:34:45.120
We did actually have the same saxophone and clarinet teacher. 

886
00:34:45.160 --> 00:34:45.760
There you go. 

887
00:34:46.240 --> 00:34:46.920
Hi, Andy. 

888
00:34:47.480 --> 00:34:47.960
Hi, Andy. 

889
00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:48.440
How are you doing? 

890
00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:49.400
Haven't they done well? 

891
00:34:49.400 --> 00:34:50.400
You've taught them so well. 

892
00:34:50.440 --> 00:34:52.000
They're baking cakes instead. 

893
00:34:53.400 --> 00:34:54.200
I don't know. 

894
00:34:54.680 --> 00:34:56.320
No, he ain't ready. 

895
00:34:57.640 --> 00:34:59.560
This cake hasn't ready yet. 

896
00:34:59.560 --> 00:35:00.080
I'm worried. 

897
00:35:00.120 --> 00:35:00.920
I opened the oven. 

898
00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:01.560
They'll go. 

899
00:35:04.040 --> 00:35:04.320
All right. 

900
00:35:04.320 --> 00:35:05.560
Mine have to be done, though. 

901
00:35:06.240 --> 00:35:06.400
Oh. 

902
00:35:06.400 --> 00:35:07.200
Someone's ready. 

903
00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:09.480
Oh, this is not good. 

904
00:35:09.480 --> 00:35:10.480
They've sunk. 

905
00:35:10.840 --> 00:35:12.480
Ah, nightmare. 

906
00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:14.760
The cake just wasn't cooked long enough. 

907
00:35:15.360 --> 00:35:18.360
Change of temperature from the oven to the cold heater. 

908
00:35:19.840 --> 00:35:21.320
I'm just gonna have to go with it. 

909
00:35:22.560 --> 00:35:25.000
Bakers, you have half an hour left. 

910
00:35:25.160 --> 00:35:31.080
Also, bakers, remember, as hard as it is to make a red velvet cake, I've actually made a red velvet coat. 

911
00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:32.920
Come on then, babies. 

912
00:35:33.080 --> 00:35:34.240
My sponges are ready. 

913
00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:35.080
Smooth. 

914
00:35:36.640 --> 00:35:37.720
I'm very pleased. 

915
00:35:39.160 --> 00:35:40.000
Oh, yeah. 

916
00:35:40.200 --> 00:35:41.320
I'm happy with that. 

917
00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:43.080
Just calm down my nerves. 

918
00:35:43.120 --> 00:35:44.840
Mason is slowly coming back. 

919
00:35:45.960 --> 00:35:46.920
That looks weird. 

920
00:35:46.960 --> 00:35:49.000
I don't know whether it's moist or undercooked. 

921
00:35:49.160 --> 00:35:52.480
Yeah, I was gonna high five you, but I've seen your palms there to read? 

922
00:35:52.520 --> 00:35:53.120
Good luck! 

923
00:35:53.800 --> 00:35:59.640
Slice each sponge in half horizontally, remove the bowl of icing from the fridge and put it together. 

924
00:36:00.160 --> 00:36:02.200
To achieve the height the judges expect. 

925
00:36:02.200 --> 00:36:05.040
Their frosting must be the perfect consistency. 

926
00:36:05.040 --> 00:36:06.720
It's a bit liquidy, I think. 

927
00:36:06.760 --> 00:36:08.440
And generously applied. 

928
00:36:08.480 --> 00:36:10.440
I'm trying to make proper even layers. 

929
00:36:11.560 --> 00:36:14.920
I just want to try to get the height like a proper big one. 

930
00:36:15.600 --> 00:36:17.920
To decorate neatly coat the cake. 

931
00:36:18.200 --> 00:36:19.760
I would rather do something different. 

932
00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:21.320
I'm going for a semi-naked look. 

933
00:36:21.320 --> 00:36:22.480
Definitely for this one. 

934
00:36:22.520 --> 00:36:24.200
You know you can go for that distressed look. 

935
00:36:24.280 --> 00:36:27.360
A sprinkle of the leftover crumbs around the bottom edge. 

936
00:36:27.680 --> 00:36:30.400
They're going to be fairly scant crumbs. 

937
00:36:30.600 --> 00:36:32.400
Type eight rosette. 

938
00:36:32.760 --> 00:36:33.480
Nearly there. 

939
00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:35.120
My icing is melting. 

940
00:36:35.400 --> 00:36:36.040
Oh man. 

941
00:36:36.280 --> 00:36:38.000
It will be a blob of rosette. 

942
00:36:39.720 --> 00:36:41.800
Going mad with piping trying to show off. 

943
00:36:41.800 --> 00:36:45.480
I want this presentation to be like, you know, like up there. 

944
00:36:46.160 --> 00:36:48.520
Bakers, you have one minute left. 

945
00:36:49.240 --> 00:36:49.560
Crumbs. 

946
00:36:49.840 --> 00:36:50.360
Crumbs. 

947
00:36:50.680 --> 00:36:51.080
All. 

948
00:36:51.160 --> 00:36:51.640
Blimey. 

949
00:36:52.040 --> 00:36:52.720
It isn't, it isn't it. 

950
00:36:52.720 --> 00:36:53.640
Isn't it isn't it isn't. 

951
00:36:54.120 --> 00:36:55.160
It isn't scary. 

952
00:36:55.760 --> 00:36:56.360
Focus. 

953
00:36:57.440 --> 00:36:58.000
Bakers. 

954
00:36:58.000 --> 00:36:59.920
Your time is up. 

955
00:37:00.720 --> 00:37:01.440
Oh, this is not good. 

956
00:37:01.480 --> 00:37:02.320
That's not good. 

957
00:37:02.360 --> 00:37:02.960
Breathe. 

958
00:37:03.600 --> 00:37:05.280
This is the height that I want 

959
00:37:06.520 --> 00:37:06.920
done. 

960
00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:09.800
Well, I can see that everyone is going for a completely different style. 

961
00:37:09.920 --> 00:37:12.960
You cannot tell at the moment who has the right idea. 

962
00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:16.680
That distressed look is a decision I may well regret. 

963
00:37:16.720 --> 00:37:19.760
Oh, this is getting me like angels. 

964
00:37:19.800 --> 00:37:20.480
Decorations. 

965
00:37:20.480 --> 00:37:21.160
Immaculate. 

966
00:37:21.640 --> 00:37:22.760
It's really sunk. 

967
00:37:23.440 --> 00:37:24.560
I'm so annoyed. 

968
00:38:31.360 --> 00:38:35.240
Bakers, please bring your velvet cakes down to the tablecloth. 

969
00:38:35.240 --> 00:38:37.160
Put them behind your photograph. 

970
00:38:37.200 --> 00:38:38.640
The gingham altar of doom. 

971
00:38:39.200 --> 00:38:41.320
Oh, man, my icing is melting. 

972
00:38:41.680 --> 00:38:42.640
Oh, I don't know. 

973
00:38:44.040 --> 00:38:44.280
Joe. 

974
00:38:44.280 --> 00:38:46.360
I'm really intrigued by the different heights. 

975
00:38:46.400 --> 00:38:46.840
Yeah. 

976
00:38:46.880 --> 00:38:48.000
Sabera. Yours is well. 

977
00:38:48.040 --> 00:38:56.800
Tall Paul and Prue are expecting 12 tall red velvet cakes coated in fluffy cream cheese frosting and decorated with a sprinkling of crumbs. 

978
00:38:58.160 --> 00:39:00.480
They have no idea whose is whose. 

979
00:39:01.560 --> 00:39:02.600
Oh, God. 

980
00:39:03.080 --> 00:39:03.400
Okay. 

981
00:39:03.440 --> 00:39:04.440
Starting over here. 

982
00:39:05.760 --> 00:39:08.480
It is smooth, but it's not that tall, is it? 

983
00:39:10.360 --> 00:39:11.200
That's nicely. 

984
00:39:12.600 --> 00:39:14.520
Not much cream cheese filling in there, is it? 

985
00:39:14.560 --> 00:39:18.280
Cream cheese should be almost equal to the cake to keep that height. 

986
00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:22.760
Tastes good. 

987
00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:24.840
Soft with a little bit of tartness. 

988
00:39:24.880 --> 00:39:26.000
Moving on to number two. 

989
00:39:26.040 --> 00:39:27.040
Piping is good. 

990
00:39:27.080 --> 00:39:29.840
But the crumb on the outside, it's too thick. 

991
00:39:33.360 --> 00:39:34.400
The flavors are right. 

992
00:39:34.440 --> 00:39:35.760
It's only got the tang to it. 

993
00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:37.120
Right over here. 

994
00:39:37.160 --> 00:39:38.480
This one's really attractive. 

995
00:39:38.680 --> 00:39:39.040
Mhm. 

996
00:39:41.160 --> 00:39:44.120
But I think the cake is slightly undercooked. 

997
00:39:44.160 --> 00:39:46.440
And I also think there's quite a lot of red in this one. 

998
00:39:46.480 --> 00:39:47.600
Yeah, it's very red. 

999
00:39:47.640 --> 00:39:48.760
You asked for crimson. 

1000
00:39:50.200 --> 00:39:51.800
It's the wrong shade of crimson, Matt. 

1001
00:39:51.800 --> 00:39:52.760
All right, back off. 

1002
00:39:54.880 --> 00:39:55.240
Okay. 

1003
00:39:55.240 --> 00:39:55.840
Moving on. 

1004
00:39:55.880 --> 00:39:56.800
Not much height to. 

1005
00:39:56.800 --> 00:39:59.000
It needs to be a bit higher. 

1006
00:40:00.560 --> 00:40:02.240
And it's not very light. 

1007
00:40:02.280 --> 00:40:02.880
It's solid. 

1008
00:40:04.560 --> 00:40:05.800
That's a little bit claggy. 

1009
00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:07.200
Feels slightly underdone. 

1010
00:40:07.880 --> 00:40:08.400
Right. 

1011
00:40:08.440 --> 00:40:08.560
Now. 

1012
00:40:08.560 --> 00:40:11.080
This one's almost a naked cake around the outside, isn't it? 

1013
00:40:11.120 --> 00:40:12.560
Very little cream cheese. 

1014
00:40:12.560 --> 00:40:14.360
But sponge is nicely risen. 

1015
00:40:14.640 --> 00:40:15.160
Yeah, 

1016
00:40:16.680 --> 00:40:18.720
the sponge is light and tangy. 

1017
00:40:19.040 --> 00:40:20.840
So we have this one. 

1018
00:40:20.880 --> 00:40:22.880
It's quite original decoration. 

1019
00:40:22.880 --> 00:40:24.440
Looks like a wedding hat. 

1020
00:40:24.480 --> 00:40:25.440
I don't like that. 

1021
00:40:25.720 --> 00:40:27.600
Cream cheese should have been put in the layers. 

1022
00:40:27.640 --> 00:40:29.560
That's probably lost quite a bit of height through that. 

1023
00:40:30.200 --> 00:40:32.600
Sponges are all sponges, right? 

1024
00:40:32.640 --> 00:40:33.960
Just not what we wanted. 

1025
00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:34.400
Right? 

1026
00:40:34.440 --> 00:40:37.440
This one over here, it's lost its definition. 

1027
00:40:37.480 --> 00:40:38.760
Rather flat rosettes. 

1028
00:40:40.600 --> 00:40:42.960
But it's only got the tang to it. 

1029
00:40:43.240 --> 00:40:43.600
Mm. 

1030
00:40:43.720 --> 00:40:44.520
Nice flavor. 

1031
00:40:44.640 --> 00:40:45.000
Okay. 

1032
00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:45.600
Moving on. 

1033
00:40:45.640 --> 00:40:46.760
Could be a bit straighter. 

1034
00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:48.080
Yes, it's a bit on the lean. 

1035
00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:50.560
But sponges are right. 

1036
00:40:50.560 --> 00:40:51.760
You get that lightness. 

1037
00:40:52.160 --> 00:40:53.400
This is a good cake. 

1038
00:40:53.560 --> 00:40:55.600
This one's got much too much crumb on the bottom. 

1039
00:40:55.880 --> 00:40:57.360
Decoration doesn't look great. 

1040
00:40:58.760 --> 00:40:59.160
Sponge. 

1041
00:40:59.160 --> 00:41:00.080
It's actually not that bad. 

1042
00:41:00.080 --> 00:41:03.320
I just think it's lighter seeing that a little bit neater throughout. 

1043
00:41:03.560 --> 00:41:04.080
Right. 

1044
00:41:04.080 --> 00:41:04.640
This one. 

1045
00:41:04.800 --> 00:41:06.120
Big layers of sponge. 

1046
00:41:06.560 --> 00:41:07.840
The sponge is light. 

1047
00:41:08.840 --> 00:41:11.440
But the rosettes sunk all over the place. 

1048
00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:15.320
I do hope that's as good on the inside as it looks on the outside. 

1049
00:41:15.360 --> 00:41:17.640
Height of the cake is good. 

1050
00:41:17.640 --> 00:41:18.360
The definition is. 

1051
00:41:18.400 --> 00:41:20.760
This is what we were looking for when it came to the crumb. 

1052
00:41:20.800 --> 00:41:21.840
That light dusting. 

1053
00:41:21.880 --> 00:41:22.840
It's got to be good inside. 

1054
00:41:22.880 --> 00:41:24.120
It better be good inside. 

1055
00:41:25.360 --> 00:41:26.120
Nice layers. 

1056
00:41:26.160 --> 00:41:28.080
There is a lot of cream cheese there. 

1057
00:41:30.720 --> 00:41:31.560
That is very nice. 

1058
00:41:31.600 --> 00:41:32.120
That's it. 

1059
00:41:32.920 --> 00:41:33.880
Should we go home now? 

1060
00:41:37.280 --> 00:41:38.880
Okay, moving onto this one a little bit. 

1061
00:41:38.880 --> 00:41:40.440
Too much on the crumb. 

1062
00:41:40.440 --> 00:41:41.160
It's neat though, 

1063
00:41:42.560 --> 00:41:43.880
and I do like those sponges. 

1064
00:41:45.160 --> 00:41:46.640
I've got nice zing. 

1065
00:41:47.080 --> 00:41:47.680
Absolutely. 

1066
00:41:48.160 --> 00:41:52.840
Paul and Prue will now rank the red velvet cakes from 12th to first place. 

1067
00:41:52.840 --> 00:41:54.080
In 12th place. 

1068
00:41:54.160 --> 00:41:54.880
This one. 

1069
00:41:54.920 --> 00:41:55.600
Who's that? 

1070
00:41:55.600 --> 00:41:56.200
James. 

1071
00:41:56.360 --> 00:42:00.960
We didn't like the decoration much, and there's not quite enough cream in the middle. 

1072
00:42:01.160 --> 00:42:06.280
In 11th, we have Rebs basically very claggy. 

1073
00:42:06.680 --> 00:42:08.040
In 10th place. 

1074
00:42:08.040 --> 00:42:08.560
This one. 

1075
00:42:09.160 --> 00:42:11.160
Maxi, it was undercooked. 

1076
00:42:11.160 --> 00:42:12.600
Ninth, we have this one. 

1077
00:42:12.960 --> 00:42:14.320
Well, it's all over the place. 

1078
00:42:14.360 --> 00:42:14.960
Fair enough. 

1079
00:42:15.600 --> 00:42:16.640
Carol is eighth. 

1080
00:42:16.960 --> 00:42:18.080
Janusz seventh. 

1081
00:42:18.320 --> 00:42:20.640
Sixth Abdul Masum fifth. 

1082
00:42:20.840 --> 00:42:23.080
Kevin is fourth and Dawn third. 

1083
00:42:23.640 --> 00:42:24.800
We're getting close now. 

1084
00:42:24.800 --> 00:42:26.080
In second place. 

1085
00:42:27.480 --> 00:42:28.200
Who is this? 

1086
00:42:29.640 --> 00:42:33.520
Sandra could be a tiny bit higher, but it's a really good cake. 

1087
00:42:33.520 --> 00:42:34.200
Thank you. 

1088
00:42:34.280 --> 00:42:36.640
So in first place, we have. 

1089
00:42:42.160 --> 00:42:43.160
That's fantastic. 

1090
00:42:43.400 --> 00:42:44.000
Thank you. 

1091
00:42:45.640 --> 00:42:47.120
My heart just melts. 

1092
00:42:49.960 --> 00:42:50.920
Thank you so much. 

1093
00:42:52.480 --> 00:42:52.960
Well done. 

1094
00:42:52.960 --> 00:42:53.560
Shapira. 

1095
00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:00.400
If I'm upset, I'll cry. 

1096
00:43:00.440 --> 00:43:01.880
If I'm happy, I'm crying. 

1097
00:43:03.280 --> 00:43:04.760
I'm happy with second. 

1098
00:43:05.560 --> 00:43:07.680
Yeah, second is kind of first, isn't it? 

1099
00:43:08.560 --> 00:43:12.000
It wasn't the worst, but I know I've got a lot to do tomorrow. 

1100
00:43:12.040 --> 00:43:12.960
It was a disaster. 

1101
00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:14.640
Like, I just like I wasn't 12. 

1102
00:43:14.920 --> 00:43:16.600
But there's still another big. 

1103
00:43:16.640 --> 00:43:21.920
I will pick myself back up and make sure my cakes flippin well cooked this time. 

1104
00:44:31.240 --> 00:44:34.760
Just one challenge remains before this year's first star. 

1105
00:44:34.760 --> 00:44:38.880
Baker is crowned and the first person to leave the tent is revealed. 

1106
00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:40.600
So what do we think of these new bakers? 

1107
00:44:40.640 --> 00:44:42.240
Overall, the standard has been pretty good. 

1108
00:44:42.280 --> 00:44:45.200
Yeah, but I think a few people, it got to them. 

1109
00:44:45.240 --> 00:44:47.840
Rebs will is in trouble. 

1110
00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:48.720
Mason. 

1111
00:44:48.720 --> 00:44:50.520
She had a tough signature, didn't she? 

1112
00:44:50.560 --> 00:44:50.920
Yeah. 

1113
00:44:50.960 --> 00:44:52.520
So who's in line for Star Baker? 

1114
00:44:52.560 --> 00:44:54.840
I think the likes of Abdul Janusz. 

1115
00:44:54.880 --> 00:44:55.600
You know who else? 

1116
00:44:55.640 --> 00:44:56.000
Sandra. 

1117
00:44:56.040 --> 00:44:56.880
Sandra is amazing. 

1118
00:44:56.920 --> 00:44:59.920
Sandra is technically tremendously good as well. 

1119
00:44:59.960 --> 00:45:00.960
He's calming me down. 

1120
00:45:00.960 --> 00:45:02.560
I'm not even in the competition. 

1121
00:45:02.600 --> 00:45:04.200
And Shabbir is incredible. 

1122
00:45:04.240 --> 00:45:05.480
That's a technical challenge. 

1123
00:45:05.480 --> 00:45:06.720
It was actually better than mine. 

1124
00:45:06.760 --> 00:45:08.640
I mean, it's not that hard to believe, is it? 

1125
00:45:09.520 --> 00:45:10.240
Unbelievable. 

1126
00:45:10.280 --> 00:45:11.760
When's the last time you baked porn? 

1127
00:45:11.800 --> 00:45:12.440
70s. 

1128
00:45:12.600 --> 00:45:13.120
Last week. 

1129
00:45:13.160 --> 00:45:14.000
What did you bake? 

1130
00:45:14.040 --> 00:45:14.920
Blueberry muffins. 

1131
00:45:14.960 --> 00:45:15.560
Oh, lovely. 

1132
00:45:15.600 --> 00:45:16.240
Nice. 

1133
00:45:16.280 --> 00:45:17.120
As good as Shabir. 

1134
00:45:17.120 --> 00:45:18.240
Is, I was like this. 

1135
00:45:18.280 --> 00:45:18.880
Well done. 

1136
00:45:27.440 --> 00:45:28.440
Hello, bakers. 

1137
00:45:28.440 --> 00:45:31.920
It's time for your first ever showstopper challenge. 

1138
00:45:31.920 --> 00:45:40.640
And today, the judges would love you to make a stunning 3D replica of your own home entirely out of cake. 

1139
00:45:40.680 --> 00:45:45.760
Your showstopper should look like somewhere you have lived, which has special meaning to you. 

1140
00:45:45.800 --> 00:45:50.160
It needs to be so good that Paul can live inside it for a week. 

1141
00:45:50.160 --> 00:45:52.400
He's basically having his bathroom renovated. 

1142
00:45:52.400 --> 00:45:53.720
He needs somewhere to crash. 

1143
00:45:54.320 --> 00:45:55.920
You have four hours. 

1144
00:45:55.920 --> 00:45:57.080
On your marks. 

1145
00:45:57.080 --> 00:45:57.880
Get set. 

1146
00:45:57.920 --> 00:45:58.440
Bake. 

1147
00:46:01.680 --> 00:46:03.040
Oh, it's so quiet in here. 

1148
00:46:03.080 --> 00:46:04.360
Concentration. 

1149
00:46:04.400 --> 00:46:05.760
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo. 

1150
00:46:05.840 --> 00:46:07.320
Yesterday wasn't my day. 

1151
00:46:07.320 --> 00:46:08.640
But today's going to be my day. 

1152
00:46:08.680 --> 00:46:12.440
I want to just show them that I am a better baker than Claggy cake. 

1153
00:46:13.400 --> 00:46:15.160
This is their first showstopper. 

1154
00:46:15.160 --> 00:46:16.440
And it's a home bake. 

1155
00:46:16.480 --> 00:46:18.080
A bake of their home. 

1156
00:46:18.080 --> 00:46:19.280
It could be anything. 

1157
00:46:19.320 --> 00:46:21.920
A cottage, a block of flats, a bungalow. 

1158
00:46:21.920 --> 00:46:23.120
But I want detail. 

1159
00:46:23.160 --> 00:46:24.320
You know, we want the pebbledash. 

1160
00:46:24.320 --> 00:46:25.880
And we want the ivy floating up the sides. 

1161
00:46:25.880 --> 00:46:27.280
We want the window frames. 

1162
00:46:27.320 --> 00:46:30.360
Of course, the most important thing is that it's solid. 

1163
00:46:30.360 --> 00:46:32.000
We don't want the roof blowing off. 

1164
00:46:32.040 --> 00:46:33.680
We don't want the walls falling down. 

1165
00:46:33.720 --> 00:46:39.120
We want to see 12 fabulous homes looking amazing and tasting even better. 

1166
00:46:40.320 --> 00:46:41.080
Morning, dawn. 

1167
00:46:41.440 --> 00:46:42.160
Good morning. 

1168
00:46:42.200 --> 00:46:42.840
Morning. 

1169
00:46:42.880 --> 00:46:44.600
Tell us all about your home bake. 

1170
00:46:44.720 --> 00:46:46.960
So my home bake is my nans house. 

1171
00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:47.760
Did you live in it? 

1172
00:46:47.920 --> 00:46:49.480
I was born in it, actually. 

1173
00:46:49.560 --> 00:46:50.480
So was my mum. 

1174
00:46:50.520 --> 00:46:53.320
It's a three bed semi and it's pebbledashed. 

1175
00:46:53.520 --> 00:47:03.040
Daum will recreate her nan's pebbledash from praline, while inside, apricot puree and German buttercream will be sandwiched between layers of delicate Genoese sponge. 

1176
00:47:03.160 --> 00:47:04.480
So it's 12 layers. 

1177
00:47:04.640 --> 00:47:05.720
Freestanding. 

1178
00:47:05.760 --> 00:47:11.240
Interesting that you're using Genoese, which is notoriously quite a soft thing with 12 layers with heavy cakes. 

1179
00:47:11.280 --> 00:47:11.560
Yep. 

1180
00:47:11.600 --> 00:47:12.160
Interesting. 

1181
00:47:12.160 --> 00:47:12.760
Good luck. 

1182
00:47:12.800 --> 00:47:13.160
Thank you. 

1183
00:47:13.200 --> 00:47:13.720
Thank you. 

1184
00:47:13.960 --> 00:47:17.480
Dawn's not the only baker inspired by memories of their nan. 

1185
00:47:17.800 --> 00:47:19.600
When I was younger, I would go there for Christmas. 

1186
00:47:19.640 --> 00:47:21.880
It'll be like about 70 of us. 

1187
00:47:22.240 --> 00:47:24.080
It was like my best childhood memories. 

1188
00:47:24.120 --> 00:47:31.280
Sandro will build his grandparents home from strawberry sponge, which he'll soak in strawberry liqueur for some extra Christmas spirit. 

1189
00:47:31.320 --> 00:47:35.480
We used to leave our Christmas parties with beanbags full of presents when we were younger. 

1190
00:47:35.520 --> 00:47:36.920
Now I can barely get socks. 

1191
00:47:37.840 --> 00:47:39.240
Just grandparents. 

1192
00:47:39.240 --> 00:47:40.360
If you're listening to this. 

1193
00:47:40.400 --> 00:47:40.920
I know. 

1194
00:47:41.080 --> 00:47:42.360
Presents get worse as you. 

1195
00:47:42.360 --> 00:47:42.680
Get older. 

1196
00:47:42.720 --> 00:47:43.720
Yeah, they do get worse. 

1197
00:47:43.760 --> 00:47:44.520
Socks. 

1198
00:47:44.680 --> 00:47:45.480
I can't afford socks. 

1199
00:47:45.480 --> 00:47:46.640
Is that what you're trying to say to me? 

1200
00:47:47.920 --> 00:47:50.160
And it seems the festive cheer is spreading. 

1201
00:47:50.200 --> 00:47:54.360
I'm using polish, ginger, spices and oranges in my chocolate cake. 

1202
00:47:54.360 --> 00:47:57.600
Because what is the better time to go and visit your mum than Christmas? 

1203
00:47:57.640 --> 00:48:08.440
Janusz spent many a happy Christmas in Poland and it's his mum's flat he'll recreate, from rich chocolate sponge and spiced orange buttercream, colourfully decorated to bring her garden balcony to life. 

1204
00:48:08.480 --> 00:48:16.120
It was a very sad block of flats, but I could always tell where my mum is because it was the only balcony where you could actually see flowers. 

1205
00:48:16.800 --> 00:48:18.240
So this is the final cake mix. 

1206
00:48:18.240 --> 00:48:19.720
I couldn't actually get a bowl big enough. 

1207
00:48:19.760 --> 00:48:21.120
I think it's a two spoon job. 

1208
00:48:21.880 --> 00:48:23.800
Building a showstopper this big. 

1209
00:48:23.960 --> 00:48:26.080
In total there is five kilograms of butter. 

1210
00:48:26.120 --> 00:48:27.840
I mean, I'm making a house, right? 

1211
00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:30.720
Requires a sponge that not only tastes great. 

1212
00:48:30.760 --> 00:48:33.120
I'm adding soy sauce instead of salt. 

1213
00:48:33.160 --> 00:48:35.040
It makes it more rich umami flavor. 

1214
00:48:35.040 --> 00:48:38.240
But it's sturdy enough to support the weight of their construction. 

1215
00:48:38.280 --> 00:48:38.880
Come on. 

1216
00:48:39.120 --> 00:48:42.280
This is a Madeira cake, which is a proper structural cake. 

1217
00:48:42.320 --> 00:48:44.960
I'm not particularly concerned about the sponge. 

1218
00:48:44.960 --> 00:48:46.200
It's pretty stable. 

1219
00:48:46.240 --> 00:48:47.640
It's a banana cake. 

1220
00:48:47.680 --> 00:48:49.800
It's my mum's recipe that I've tweaked a little. 

1221
00:48:49.840 --> 00:48:51.880
With a roof and windows built from biscuit. 

1222
00:48:51.880 --> 00:48:58.680
Kevin's childhood home will contain fresh banana and maple buttercream between layers of his mum's pecan packed banana bread. 

1223
00:48:58.720 --> 00:49:02.600
I haven't chopped them too finely because I reckon that would actually dry out the sponge. 

1224
00:49:02.640 --> 00:49:03.000
And 

1225
00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:05.360
I do like a bit of texture. 

1226
00:49:05.360 --> 00:49:06.120
I do like. 

1227
00:49:06.440 --> 00:49:07.600
Nice big nuts. 

1228
00:49:08.160 --> 00:49:10.120
This is coffee and walnut. 

1229
00:49:10.160 --> 00:49:14.320
Who doesn't like coffee and walnut unless you don't like coffee or are allergic to nuts? 

1230
00:49:14.600 --> 00:49:17.800
I am making a replica of my little bungalow. 

1231
00:49:18.400 --> 00:49:23.960
Carol will build her beloved bungalow from another of her favourite classic cake recipes, coffee and walnut. 

1232
00:49:24.160 --> 00:49:29.400
But instead of adding real coffee to her buttercream and sponge, she's opted for a retro replacement. 

1233
00:49:29.800 --> 00:49:30.640
It's chicory. 

1234
00:49:30.920 --> 00:49:32.360
It's when you couldn't get coffee. 

1235
00:49:32.360 --> 00:49:34.320
I think maybe when the war was on. 

1236
00:49:34.320 --> 00:49:35.120
I'm not sure. 

1237
00:49:35.840 --> 00:49:37.200
You smell it, can't you? 

1238
00:49:37.360 --> 00:49:38.960
That'll put hairs on your chest. 

1239
00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:39.400
Okay. 

1240
00:49:39.520 --> 00:49:42.000
Going in with so much cake to bake. 

1241
00:49:42.040 --> 00:49:42.520
All done. 

1242
00:49:42.520 --> 00:49:44.320
And the sponges are ready to go to the oven. 

1243
00:49:44.360 --> 00:49:45.560
The quicker they're sponges. 

1244
00:49:45.560 --> 00:49:46.280
Hit the heat. 

1245
00:49:46.520 --> 00:49:47.280
Off you go. 

1246
00:49:47.360 --> 00:49:49.600
The more time they'll have to cool and cut them. 

1247
00:49:49.640 --> 00:49:53.680
I'm trying to make them not too thick because then they cook quicker and cool quicker. 

1248
00:49:54.120 --> 00:49:59.160
Any attempt to build their homes from warm sponge will result in a subsidence nightmare. 

1249
00:49:59.640 --> 00:50:01.280
I'll remember to set the timer today. 

1250
00:50:01.600 --> 00:50:04.240
But Will's making life doubly difficult for himself. 

1251
00:50:04.280 --> 00:50:05.440
I'm also making a chocolate cake. 

1252
00:50:05.480 --> 00:50:08.920
It's slightly drier, which I think is good for the structure. 

1253
00:50:08.960 --> 00:50:19.920
After a disappointing first day, Will's looking to impress by constructing his old north London flat from two sponges, one chocolate and one orange, with architectural details made from gingerbread. 

1254
00:50:19.960 --> 00:50:22.560
So you've got gingerbread, you've got sponge, you've got orange. 

1255
00:50:23.200 --> 00:50:23.920
Lot to do. 

1256
00:50:24.120 --> 00:50:25.880
Hopefully you get away with it at the time. 

1257
00:50:25.920 --> 00:50:26.480
Thank you. 

1258
00:50:26.520 --> 00:50:27.000
I know. 

1259
00:50:27.960 --> 00:50:32.000
Just a stone's throw away in southeast London is the flat where Maxie grew up. 

1260
00:50:32.360 --> 00:50:34.920
It's my mum's block where I started baking. 

1261
00:50:34.960 --> 00:50:40.480
Flavours are inspired by a family favourite, which is my mum's apple and berry crumble. 

1262
00:50:40.640 --> 00:50:47.120
Maxie will spread her mum's famous apple and berry compote, along with a crumble topping between layers of cinnamon sponge. 

1263
00:50:47.320 --> 00:50:48.720
Are you enjoying your time here? 

1264
00:50:48.760 --> 00:50:51.440
I am, I just, you know, I get a bit stressed sometimes. 

1265
00:50:51.440 --> 00:50:53.200
Who are you scared of more Prue or Paul? 

1266
00:50:53.600 --> 00:50:57.240
Paul has got a tough exterior, like a crusty roll. 

1267
00:50:58.960 --> 00:51:03.200
He's like a crusty bat, but when you break him open, he's all soft inside. 

1268
00:51:03.880 --> 00:51:04.640
And he's good. 

1269
00:51:04.680 --> 00:51:06.560
You know, a little bit of butter toasted. 

1270
00:51:07.480 --> 00:51:07.880
So 

1271
00:51:09.480 --> 00:51:10.720
this has gone weird, isn't it? 

1272
00:51:10.960 --> 00:51:11.480
This? 

1273
00:51:11.520 --> 00:51:11.680
No. 

1274
00:51:11.680 --> 00:51:12.320
This conversation. 

1275
00:51:12.320 --> 00:51:13.160
This conversation. 

1276
00:51:14.520 --> 00:51:16.000
How are you looking, cakes? 

1277
00:51:16.280 --> 00:51:18.080
I just want to double check if it's cooked. 

1278
00:51:19.280 --> 00:51:19.720
Yep. 

1279
00:51:20.440 --> 00:51:22.040
Shouldn't be too dry, huh? 

1280
00:51:22.160 --> 00:51:24.160
I'm gonna take my small sponges out of the oven. 

1281
00:51:24.160 --> 00:51:25.480
They seem to be all ready. 

1282
00:51:25.640 --> 00:51:26.920
I hope it's cooked. 

1283
00:51:27.520 --> 00:51:28.160
God. 

1284
00:51:28.840 --> 00:51:30.760
I don't want to over bake it. 

1285
00:51:30.920 --> 00:51:32.760
I just want it to be perfect. 

1286
00:51:33.560 --> 00:51:36.120
So I'm going to let the sponges cool for as long as I can. 

1287
00:51:38.040 --> 00:51:41.000
I know my oven wasn't on in hell. 

1288
00:51:42.600 --> 00:51:44.720
My oven wasn't on for the past 40 minutes. 

1289
00:51:45.880 --> 00:51:54.560
If Abdul can bake his sponges in time, he'll build his grandparents home in Pakistan with mango and saffron jam sandwiched between layers of masala chai. 

1290
00:51:54.600 --> 00:51:59.680
Spiced sponge cooling time and everything is now challenging because I've lost about 40 minutes. 

1291
00:51:59.680 --> 00:52:02.160
But keep going, keep going and trying, right? 

1292
00:52:02.680 --> 00:52:06.040
Shabir is also hoping to tempt the judges with a cuppa milk. 

1293
00:52:06.040 --> 00:52:09.160
Tea is something we drink all the time in Malaysia. 

1294
00:52:09.200 --> 00:52:10.920
And in a bid for top spot. 

1295
00:52:11.560 --> 00:52:12.280
Kirsty. 

1296
00:52:12.760 --> 00:52:15.840
Her cake contains not just one but two types of tea. 

1297
00:52:16.080 --> 00:52:19.360
Milk tea is the main flavour that I want to bring in. 

1298
00:52:19.440 --> 00:52:21.040
and match our complement. 

1299
00:52:21.040 --> 00:52:30.640
Milk tea filled with strawberry and cinnamon jam and matcha buttercream, Shibuya's Milk Tea sponges will form the childhood home and tropical garden she loved to play in growing up. 

1300
00:52:30.880 --> 00:52:32.200
I can't imagine where you live. 

1301
00:52:32.400 --> 00:52:36.680
So somewhere fantastical in a shoe, a golden shoe. 

1302
00:52:36.720 --> 00:52:46.920
I live in a village, very small little house with coconut tree around it, so we usually try to climb the coconut because we thought if monkey could do it, we also could do it. 

1303
00:52:48.960 --> 00:52:52.240
I can tell this is going to be my favorite chat of the day already. 

1304
00:52:53.400 --> 00:52:54.480
In theory, this is done. 

1305
00:52:55.120 --> 00:52:57.720
As world's final sponge exits the oven. 

1306
00:52:57.880 --> 00:52:58.480
There we go. 

1307
00:52:59.360 --> 00:53:00.160
Oh boy. 

1308
00:53:00.200 --> 00:53:01.880
Closely followed by Abdul's. 

1309
00:53:01.920 --> 00:53:03.040
It's okay, it's okay. 

1310
00:53:03.360 --> 00:53:04.680
It landed the right side up. 

1311
00:53:04.720 --> 00:53:05.160
Yes. 

1312
00:53:05.560 --> 00:53:06.520
Today is not my day. 

1313
00:53:06.520 --> 00:53:07.000
Is it. 

1314
00:53:07.440 --> 00:53:08.000
Cold? 

1315
00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:09.000
Cold? 

1316
00:53:09.040 --> 00:53:09.880
Cold, cold. 

1317
00:53:09.880 --> 00:53:12.640
The rest of the bakers are ready to begin building. 

1318
00:53:12.680 --> 00:53:14.360
Their cooled enough to start stacking. 

1319
00:53:14.360 --> 00:53:15.280
And of course. 

1320
00:53:15.560 --> 00:53:19.400
The soak I'm going to be fairly generous with this. 

1321
00:53:19.440 --> 00:53:20.920
Want it to be perfection? 

1322
00:53:21.480 --> 00:53:23.400
This is strawberries and cream liqueur. 

1323
00:53:23.440 --> 00:53:24.560
I'm going to add all of it. 

1324
00:53:25.120 --> 00:53:26.160
Grown up cake. 

1325
00:53:26.160 --> 00:53:29.440
But Sandro's grown up cake won't be drinking alone. 

1326
00:53:30.240 --> 00:53:31.560
Plenty of coconut rum. 

1327
00:53:32.200 --> 00:53:33.600
Whoa! That was hot. 

1328
00:53:33.880 --> 00:53:36.720
During lockdown because obviously we couldn't go anywhere. 

1329
00:53:36.760 --> 00:53:39.400
Me and my parents would just have, like, a cocktail night. 

1330
00:53:39.400 --> 00:53:43.000
So this is one of the ones that went down a treat with a pina colada. 

1331
00:53:43.160 --> 00:53:51.360
Rebs plans to bring party vibes to her house with flambéed, pineapple rings and rum buttercream sandwiched between layers of a rum soaked coconut sponge. 

1332
00:53:51.560 --> 00:53:56.240
It's really important for me to get the sponge right today because I didn't cook mine sponge properly yesterday. 

1333
00:54:02.560 --> 00:54:03.200
Oh my goodness. 

1334
00:54:03.520 --> 00:54:04.280
You're joking. 

1335
00:54:05.680 --> 00:54:07.040
My cake's not fully done. 

1336
00:54:08.640 --> 00:54:09.880
But Rebs party. 

1337
00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:11.280
They're not fully cooked. 

1338
00:54:11.480 --> 00:54:12.640
Might be off. 

1339
00:54:13.880 --> 00:54:15.720
Um, I don't know what I'm going to do. 

1340
00:54:16.040 --> 00:54:16.520
Um, 

1341
00:54:17.560 --> 00:54:20.000
I just need a minute to myself. 

1342
00:54:21.680 --> 00:54:22.800
I feel like I'm gonna be sick. 

1343
00:55:31.200 --> 00:55:33.320
You know, it was your turn to do the time call. 

1344
00:55:33.320 --> 00:55:34.800
And then I just spoke over you. 

1345
00:55:34.840 --> 00:55:37.840
It was really out of order, so I won't ever do that again. 

1346
00:55:37.840 --> 00:55:38.400
So go on. 

1347
00:55:38.440 --> 00:55:39.040
You do the time. 

1348
00:55:39.280 --> 00:55:39.640
Really? 

1349
00:55:39.680 --> 00:55:39.920
Yeah. 

1350
00:55:39.960 --> 00:55:40.520
This is your. 

1351
00:55:40.520 --> 00:55:40.760
Time. 

1352
00:55:40.840 --> 00:55:41.280
No, no, no. 

1353
00:55:41.320 --> 00:55:41.680
This one. 

1354
00:55:41.720 --> 00:55:42.080
This one's. 

1355
00:55:42.080 --> 00:55:42.240
Yours. 

1356
00:55:42.280 --> 00:55:43.160
You're giving me your time. 

1357
00:55:43.160 --> 00:55:44.080
I'm giving you my time. 

1358
00:55:44.600 --> 00:55:46.400
Bakers, you are halfway through. 

1359
00:55:46.440 --> 00:55:48.120
Sorry, I forgot, I forgot. 

1360
00:55:48.160 --> 00:55:52.480
I would like to be carving cakes by now, but I've still got gingerbread to make. 

1361
00:55:52.520 --> 00:55:54.680
I think I'm going to struggle with time. 

1362
00:55:54.720 --> 00:55:56.760
And Will's not the only one struggling. 

1363
00:55:56.800 --> 00:55:57.680
My sponge. 

1364
00:55:57.720 --> 00:55:59.640
They've just not really fully cooked. 

1365
00:55:59.640 --> 00:56:00.440
I don't know why. 

1366
00:56:00.480 --> 00:56:03.560
But Rebs has a cunning plan to get back on track. 

1367
00:56:03.600 --> 00:56:04.800
This one's okay. 

1368
00:56:04.840 --> 00:56:07.720
I'm just going to take a ring a cake from here and put it in. 

1369
00:56:10.640 --> 00:56:11.520
Look, you'd never know. 

1370
00:56:11.720 --> 00:56:12.320
It's fine, it's fine. 

1371
00:56:12.320 --> 00:56:13.000
I'm not going to panic. 

1372
00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:13.840
Why would I panic? 

1373
00:56:14.080 --> 00:56:15.280
Panic is for losers 

1374
00:56:16.440 --> 00:56:17.440
constructing now. 

1375
00:56:17.440 --> 00:56:18.560
So we're layering up. 

1376
00:56:18.560 --> 00:56:19.600
This is going in now. 

1377
00:56:19.760 --> 00:56:20.520
My crumble. 

1378
00:56:20.680 --> 00:56:21.840
Kevin's just bashing. 

1379
00:56:21.840 --> 00:56:22.040
Stuff. 

1380
00:56:22.080 --> 00:56:23.720
Yeah, this wasn't even part of the recipe. 

1381
00:56:23.760 --> 00:56:25.760
Who are you imagining that is Paul or Peru? 

1382
00:56:25.800 --> 00:56:26.640
Well, what one is it? 

1383
00:56:26.640 --> 00:56:27.200
The same color. 

1384
00:56:27.400 --> 00:56:28.320
It's Paul, isn't it? 

1385
00:56:28.560 --> 00:56:29.200
What is that? 

1386
00:56:29.240 --> 00:56:30.040
It's about Scotch. 

1387
00:56:30.080 --> 00:56:30.600
Butterscotch. 

1388
00:56:30.600 --> 00:56:31.600
That's what he takes. 

1389
00:56:31.640 --> 00:56:32.880
It's a tanning salon. 

1390
00:56:33.160 --> 00:56:34.200
I want to look like this. 

1391
00:56:34.920 --> 00:56:36.360
Carol, look at this color. 

1392
00:56:36.400 --> 00:56:38.800
Oh, without any food coloring. 

1393
00:56:39.120 --> 00:56:42.280
This is my childhood house back home in Libya. 

1394
00:56:42.320 --> 00:56:52.280
Taking inspiration from her favorite lemon tree growing up, Maisam will fill her lemon sponge with blueberry jam and add colorful decoration to give the house the finish Paul and Prue expect. 

1395
00:56:52.440 --> 00:56:57.840
If I just speed up a little bit, then I can give them that finesse that they want. 

1396
00:56:58.000 --> 00:56:58.520
Oh no. 

1397
00:57:00.400 --> 00:57:01.320
Small explosion. 

1398
00:57:01.360 --> 00:57:04.200
James two has been inspired by a childhood memory. 

1399
00:57:04.240 --> 00:57:06.840
My dad used to have a cottage up in Loch Fyne. 

1400
00:57:06.880 --> 00:57:09.480
It's the first place I remember getting terrified. 

1401
00:57:09.480 --> 00:57:13.920
We watched Dracula, and while we were watching it, my dad wandered by with an axe outside of the door. 

1402
00:57:13.960 --> 00:57:15.360
It was like a 4D experience. 

1403
00:57:16.200 --> 00:57:17.680
James is frightfully tasty. 

1404
00:57:17.720 --> 00:57:24.640
Cottage will contain orange curd and orange blossom buttercream spread between six thick layers of orange and cardamom sponge. 

1405
00:57:24.680 --> 00:57:29.080
It's oozing a tiny bit, but surprisingly okay because it is quite a lot of weight on top. 

1406
00:57:29.120 --> 00:57:30.400
But we'll find out, I guess. 

1407
00:57:31.480 --> 00:57:33.880
Bakers, you have 30 minutes. 

1408
00:57:34.080 --> 00:57:34.400
Oh. 

1409
00:57:36.120 --> 00:57:37.320
Definitely behind. 

1410
00:57:37.360 --> 00:57:40.280
While Will and Abdul are still constructing their homes. 

1411
00:57:40.280 --> 00:57:43.120
My plan is to disassemble this and then as much as I can decor. 

1412
00:57:43.160 --> 00:57:44.880
I'll try for the rest of the bakers. 

1413
00:57:44.880 --> 00:57:47.160
It's a nail biting race to the finish. 

1414
00:57:47.360 --> 00:57:48.840
I'm trying to be mean. 

1415
00:57:48.880 --> 00:57:53.360
I was over generous with the fillings, so I skipped a layer. 

1416
00:57:53.480 --> 00:57:55.960
The only person that will notice is Paul. 

1417
00:57:56.000 --> 00:57:57.600
I'm sure he'll count them all. 

1418
00:57:57.640 --> 00:57:59.440
This is sugar fondant. 

1419
00:57:59.480 --> 00:58:00.760
Samuel, is this easy to brick? 

1420
00:58:00.800 --> 00:58:03.480
A house roof under construction. 

1421
00:58:04.560 --> 00:58:06.000
My dad was a roofer as well. 

1422
00:58:06.320 --> 00:58:07.120
Irony. 

1423
00:58:07.600 --> 00:58:08.840
What can I smell? 

1424
00:58:09.720 --> 00:58:11.040
Yeah, I smell burning. 

1425
00:58:11.640 --> 00:58:12.520
It's not me, is it? 

1426
00:58:15.120 --> 00:58:16.120
A little bit overdone. 

1427
00:58:17.080 --> 00:58:17.520
I love a. 

1428
00:58:18.040 --> 00:58:18.680
Dashing. 

1429
00:58:18.800 --> 00:58:21.600
I used to get told off when I was a little girl cos we. 

1430
00:58:21.640 --> 00:58:21.920
Went. 

1431
00:58:22.120 --> 00:58:22.280
Off. 

1432
00:58:22.320 --> 00:58:22.680
Yes. 

1433
00:58:22.720 --> 00:58:25.560
I feel like this is going to tap into Paul's childhood as well. 

1434
00:58:25.840 --> 00:58:26.520
He will lie. 

1435
00:58:26.680 --> 00:58:28.000
He will identify with. 

1436
00:58:28.040 --> 00:58:29.040
People who have a clue. 

1437
00:58:29.080 --> 00:58:29.960
She won't know what it is. 

1438
00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:32.480
If you haven't got a maze around your house, she won't understand. 

1439
00:58:32.520 --> 00:58:33.200
Or a moat. 

1440
00:58:33.280 --> 00:58:34.280
Got a gate? 

1441
00:58:35.200 --> 00:58:37.280
The brickwork around the cottage. 

1442
00:58:37.320 --> 00:58:39.880
I wanted to show the sort of higgledy piggledy ness of it. 

1443
00:58:40.520 --> 00:58:42.320
Time is the limiting factor right now. 

1444
00:58:42.440 --> 00:58:45.080
I'm going to have to leave out a lot of things, I think. 

1445
00:58:45.760 --> 00:58:46.880
What are you going to do with that? 

1446
00:58:47.040 --> 00:58:48.240
I'll probably eat it later. 

1447
00:58:48.280 --> 00:58:48.800
Will you? 

1448
00:58:48.960 --> 00:58:49.280
Yeah. 

1449
00:58:49.400 --> 00:58:50.760
And what are you going to do with these? 

1450
00:58:51.680 --> 00:58:54.560
One of the main issues is the misuse of disused tissues. 

1451
00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:56.120
Embarrassing. 

1452
00:58:57.880 --> 00:59:01.120
Bakers, you have five minutes left. 

1453
00:59:02.400 --> 00:59:02.880
The stress. 

1454
00:59:02.920 --> 00:59:03.480
Is real. 

1455
00:59:03.600 --> 00:59:04.200
Come on. 

1456
00:59:04.480 --> 00:59:05.880
I have to give Christmas now. 

1457
00:59:05.880 --> 00:59:07.520
Far. The more detail, the better. 

1458
00:59:10.280 --> 00:59:11.120
Nearly there. 

1459
00:59:12.360 --> 00:59:15.240
But I'm piping clouds out of Italian meringue. 

1460
00:59:15.400 --> 00:59:16.640
What is happening here? 

1461
00:59:17.200 --> 00:59:18.760
Ah, it looks terrible. 

1462
00:59:19.520 --> 00:59:20.840
Taxi! You're not on your own. 

1463
00:59:22.200 --> 00:59:23.800
I need another couple of windows on it. 

1464
00:59:24.160 --> 00:59:25.320
My hands are shaking. 

1465
00:59:27.400 --> 00:59:28.440
Can't stop, can't stop. 

1466
00:59:29.560 --> 00:59:30.040
Wow. 

1467
00:59:30.320 --> 00:59:31.480
It's not what you think. 

1468
00:59:31.520 --> 00:59:31.840
No. 

1469
00:59:32.240 --> 00:59:32.600
What is. 

1470
00:59:32.600 --> 00:59:32.800
It? 

1471
00:59:32.840 --> 00:59:33.800
Coconut tree. 

1472
00:59:33.840 --> 00:59:36.240
So I'm making the truck. 

1473
00:59:36.440 --> 00:59:36.920
Oh, right. 

1474
00:59:36.920 --> 00:59:37.480
Okay. 

1475
00:59:37.520 --> 00:59:37.960
Yeah. 

1476
00:59:38.520 --> 00:59:44.200
I'm trying to use this burfi to make sheep's. I can't watch you do that. 

1477
00:59:44.240 --> 00:59:44.520
Sorry. 

1478
00:59:44.560 --> 00:59:46.040
It brings back too many memories. 

1479
00:59:47.480 --> 00:59:48.720
I hope it's a good one. 

1480
00:59:49.640 --> 00:59:52.040
Bakers, you have one minute left. 

1481
00:59:55.800 --> 00:59:57.120
This buttercream is split. 

1482
01:00:00.800 --> 01:00:02.720
Don't even look like squares. 

1483
01:00:02.880 --> 01:00:04.600
This is better than the red velvet cake. 

1484
01:00:04.720 --> 01:00:06.000
It's a step in the right direction. 

1485
01:00:06.320 --> 01:00:07.360
There's just some shimmer. 

1486
01:00:09.720 --> 01:00:12.960
Bakers, your time is up. 

1487
01:00:15.200 --> 01:00:18.920
Please step away from your fate. I feel so mean. 

1488
01:00:18.960 --> 01:00:21.000
What kind of showstopper is this? 

1489
01:00:21.240 --> 01:00:22.920
It's not as I pictured it. 

1490
01:00:22.960 --> 01:00:25.120
That is so, so good. 

1491
01:00:25.440 --> 01:00:26.560
It looks incredible. 

1492
01:00:27.120 --> 01:00:30.880
It's not as neat as I'd like, but it looks like my house, which is a bonus. 

1493
01:00:31.600 --> 01:00:32.920
I just don't want to go home. 

1494
01:01:33.080 --> 01:01:36.200
It's time to judge the showstopping home bakes. 

1495
01:01:36.600 --> 01:01:39.360
Rebs, would you like to bring your showstopper up, please? 

1496
01:01:39.760 --> 01:01:40.200
Precious. 

1497
01:01:40.200 --> 01:01:40.640
Happy. 

1498
01:01:41.080 --> 01:01:41.400
Oh. 

1499
01:01:43.640 --> 01:01:45.040
There's one more thing I need to get. 

1500
01:01:46.480 --> 01:01:53.560
So, I don't know if you've ever been to Northern Ireland, but it's constantly raining, so you have to have a bit of coconut rum, rain. 

1501
01:01:54.280 --> 01:01:56.320
I like the idea of coconut rum rain. 

1502
01:01:56.360 --> 01:01:56.680
I know. 

1503
01:01:56.720 --> 01:01:57.280
Nice. 

1504
01:01:57.440 --> 01:02:00.840
It does remind me of a very rural cottage. 

1505
01:02:00.920 --> 01:02:01.800
It's very good. 

1506
01:02:01.840 --> 01:02:02.960
And the detail is lovely. 

1507
01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.160
Now, this is basically a pina colada cake, isn't it? 

1508
01:02:05.200 --> 01:02:05.600
Yeah. 

1509
01:02:05.640 --> 01:02:09.720
Coconut and vanilla sponge, pineapple curd and flambed. 

1510
01:02:09.760 --> 01:02:13.400
Pineapple slices with coconut and rum buttercream. 

1511
01:02:14.160 --> 01:02:14.440
Mm. 

1512
01:02:18.760 --> 01:02:19.840
I love the flavour. 

1513
01:02:21.120 --> 01:02:22.400
The pineapple comes through. 

1514
01:02:22.440 --> 01:02:23.520
Coconut comes through. 

1515
01:02:23.760 --> 01:02:25.440
It is overbaked the sponge. 

1516
01:02:25.480 --> 01:02:26.320
Not by much. 

1517
01:02:26.360 --> 01:02:28.600
But overall I think a it looks great. 

1518
01:02:28.640 --> 01:02:30.880
B the flavours came through beautifully. 

1519
01:02:31.840 --> 01:02:32.360
Well done. 

1520
01:02:32.760 --> 01:02:33.160
Well done. 

1521
01:02:33.160 --> 01:02:34.240
Raj. I can't breathe. 

1522
01:02:34.520 --> 01:02:35.240
Should we takeaway? 

1523
01:02:35.280 --> 01:02:35.640
Yeah. 

1524
01:02:35.760 --> 01:02:36.040
Okay. 

1525
01:02:36.080 --> 01:02:36.560
Thank you. 

1526
01:02:36.800 --> 01:02:36.960
Yeah. 

1527
01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:37.560
Quit while you're. 

1528
01:02:37.560 --> 01:02:37.920
Ahead. 

1529
01:02:39.840 --> 01:02:40.520
Thank you so much. 

1530
01:02:40.560 --> 01:02:41.640
I'm going to take the tablecloth. 

1531
01:02:41.880 --> 01:02:42.480
Well done. 

1532
01:02:42.520 --> 01:02:43.000
Thank you. 

1533
01:02:44.320 --> 01:02:44.680
I'm going to. 

1534
01:02:44.680 --> 01:02:45.120
Cry. 

1535
01:02:50.520 --> 01:02:51.400
What are the windows? 

1536
01:02:51.440 --> 01:02:53.680
Sugar cookie filled with butterscotch. 

1537
01:02:53.720 --> 01:02:55.160
Did you mean to burn them? 

1538
01:02:55.280 --> 01:02:56.240
I didn't mean to. 

1539
01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.520
The banana cake itself is delicious. 

1540
01:03:02.560 --> 01:03:05.200
My only thing is cut your pecans up more. 

1541
01:03:05.240 --> 01:03:06.120
They're too big. 

1542
01:03:06.360 --> 01:03:07.640
It's a really good cake. 

1543
01:03:07.960 --> 01:03:08.640
Well done. 

1544
01:03:08.680 --> 01:03:09.240
Well done. 

1545
01:03:13.560 --> 01:03:15.280
It's beautifully neat, Carol. 

1546
01:03:15.280 --> 01:03:16.560
And the piping is beautiful. 

1547
01:03:16.560 --> 01:03:17.160
Look at that. 

1548
01:03:17.160 --> 01:03:19.120
I love the pots all around the outside. 

1549
01:03:19.960 --> 01:03:22.640
It's coffee and walnut with coffee buttercream. 

1550
01:03:24.560 --> 01:03:25.360
It's quite powerful. 

1551
01:03:25.560 --> 01:03:27.200
That coffee add a good glug. 

1552
01:03:29.960 --> 01:03:30.880
It's really powerful. 

1553
01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.720
I've never had a coffee cake that strong before. 

1554
01:03:34.800 --> 01:03:35.440
Nor me. 

1555
01:03:35.520 --> 01:03:36.880
Coffee's actually burning. 

1556
01:03:37.600 --> 01:03:38.640
That's fascinating. 

1557
01:03:39.120 --> 01:03:39.560
Wow. 

1558
01:03:40.200 --> 01:03:41.600
You've blown Paul's mind. 

1559
01:03:45.200 --> 01:03:46.720
Lots of skills showing off here. 

1560
01:03:46.720 --> 01:03:48.480
You're obviously very good at piping. 

1561
01:03:48.520 --> 01:03:49.040
Thank you. 

1562
01:03:49.920 --> 01:03:50.600
So much. 

1563
01:03:50.600 --> 01:03:52.280
Buttercream I know. 

1564
01:03:55.840 --> 01:03:57.000
It's very claggy. 

1565
01:03:57.480 --> 01:03:59.920
Especially that middle layer, which is really compressed. 

1566
01:03:59.920 --> 01:04:01.120
I think it's the weight. 

1567
01:04:01.160 --> 01:04:03.120
There's so much buttercream on there. 

1568
01:04:03.120 --> 01:04:04.400
The sponge just can't hold it. 

1569
01:04:04.440 --> 01:04:10.400
It glues your mouth together, which at the moment might be a good thing for you, but the flavours are fantastic. 

1570
01:04:14.640 --> 01:04:16.280
You obviously ran out of time. 

1571
01:04:16.280 --> 01:04:17.880
The piping's a bit clumsy. 

1572
01:04:17.920 --> 01:04:18.800
Let's have a look. 

1573
01:04:19.720 --> 01:04:20.240
Oh wow. 

1574
01:04:20.360 --> 01:04:22.040
I've never had a crumble in a cake before. 

1575
01:04:25.640 --> 01:04:27.160
I think you've done a really good job. 

1576
01:04:29.320 --> 01:04:31.760
The crumble with the compote, it's just fantastic. 

1577
01:04:31.760 --> 01:04:33.080
I think it works really well. 

1578
01:04:33.480 --> 01:04:33.960
Well done. 

1579
01:04:34.320 --> 01:04:34.960
Thank you. 

1580
01:04:35.920 --> 01:04:36.880
I was so worried. 

1581
01:04:37.760 --> 01:04:38.520
Are you all right? 

1582
01:04:38.560 --> 01:04:38.960
Yeah. 

1583
01:04:40.120 --> 01:04:40.520
Boo! 

1584
01:04:49.720 --> 01:04:51.920
You've lost a lot of the detail on the house. 

1585
01:04:51.960 --> 01:04:52.440
Yes. 

1586
01:04:52.480 --> 01:04:53.560
Did you run out of time? 

1587
01:04:53.600 --> 01:04:59.520
Unfortunately, my oven wasn't hot, which meant my cakes were delayed, so that basically pushed everything. 

1588
01:05:00.520 --> 01:05:05.640
My sponge is masala chai and in between I have mascarpone frosting and mango jam. 

1589
01:05:10.200 --> 01:05:13.440
The chai is delicious, carries really well inside the cake. 

1590
01:05:13.480 --> 01:05:14.920
I think the bakes good as well. 

1591
01:05:15.200 --> 01:05:18.280
I think it's absolutely delicious, but I would have liked more mango. 

1592
01:05:18.560 --> 01:05:22.120
Okay, I'd just like to see more detail because I think inside tastes great. 

1593
01:05:26.080 --> 01:05:27.680
It looks absolutely charming. 

1594
01:05:27.840 --> 01:05:29.880
I love it, I like the pebbledash. 

1595
01:05:29.920 --> 01:05:32.520
It's gone a bit wonky, but I'm thinking the house was wonky. 

1596
01:05:32.560 --> 01:05:33.240
Subsidence. 

1597
01:05:33.240 --> 01:05:33.720
Terrible. 

1598
01:05:33.720 --> 01:05:34.560
Subsidence. 

1599
01:05:36.080 --> 01:05:36.600
Wow. 

1600
01:05:36.640 --> 01:05:37.800
Oh, look at that. 

1601
01:05:37.840 --> 01:05:43.640
It's Genoese sponge with apricot praline and vanilla buttercream inside. 

1602
01:05:43.640 --> 01:05:44.400
How many layers? 

1603
01:05:44.400 --> 01:05:45.800
It was supposed to be 12. 

1604
01:05:45.840 --> 01:05:48.840
I'm going to be really honest and admit that there are 11. 

1605
01:05:48.880 --> 01:05:54.800
It's really brave to make Genoa's so airy that it could get squashed easily, but it hasn't squashed at all. 

1606
01:05:57.840 --> 01:05:59.360
That is a fantastic cake. 

1607
01:05:59.400 --> 01:06:05.560
You've got texture coming from the praline, the apricot is lovely and it's got a bit of tartness to that as well, which really works. 

1608
01:06:05.560 --> 01:06:08.040
The sponge is well baked, the buttercream works well. 

1609
01:06:08.640 --> 01:06:09.200
Well done. 

1610
01:06:12.680 --> 01:06:13.760
I like the whole look of it. 

1611
01:06:13.760 --> 01:06:14.920
I think it's charming. 

1612
01:06:14.920 --> 01:06:16.360
The detail in there is lovely. 

1613
01:06:16.400 --> 01:06:19.160
So this has got a lot of interesting flavours in this, hasn't it? 

1614
01:06:19.200 --> 01:06:24.240
It is milk tea sponge with strawberry jam and matcha buttercream. 

1615
01:06:25.160 --> 01:06:25.760
It's nice. 

1616
01:06:31.200 --> 01:06:32.680
I think your textures are beautiful. 

1617
01:06:33.360 --> 01:06:34.720
The baking element is perfect. 

1618
01:06:34.720 --> 01:06:36.120
Those sponges are delicious. 

1619
01:06:36.160 --> 01:06:40.080
My issue is there's no hero flavour. 

1620
01:06:40.240 --> 01:06:42.320
There's so many little things going on in there. 

1621
01:06:42.360 --> 01:06:44.160
There's matcha, there's strawberry. 

1622
01:06:44.200 --> 01:06:46.720
The tea flavour is not strong enough. 

1623
01:06:50.560 --> 01:06:51.400
Oh my God. 

1624
01:06:51.480 --> 01:06:53.040
I recognize that vlog now. 

1625
01:06:53.800 --> 01:06:54.280
Really? 

1626
01:06:54.560 --> 01:06:54.760
Yeah. 

1627
01:06:54.760 --> 01:06:56.040
We live near each other. 

1628
01:06:56.800 --> 01:06:57.760
That's brilliant. 

1629
01:07:00.280 --> 01:07:01.040
So good. 

1630
01:07:02.120 --> 01:07:03.640
You've overbaked everyone. 

1631
01:07:03.680 --> 01:07:04.040
Ah. 

1632
01:07:06.600 --> 01:07:08.840
I think the chocolate could have been a bit more punchy. 

1633
01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:09.920
Love the orange. 

1634
01:07:09.920 --> 01:07:12.080
But it comes down to the bake for me. 

1635
01:07:16.160 --> 01:07:19.080
It's not perfectly decorated, is it? 

1636
01:07:19.120 --> 01:07:20.440
It's a little bit clumsy. 

1637
01:07:20.920 --> 01:07:22.240
Well, let's have a look, shall we? 

1638
01:07:22.280 --> 01:07:26.040
It's lemon, which is inspired by the lemon trees in that house. 

1639
01:07:29.320 --> 01:07:29.560
Mm. 

1640
01:07:31.320 --> 01:07:32.360
It's quite dense. 

1641
01:07:33.280 --> 01:07:35.760
That doesn't take away the fact that I actually love the flavour. 

1642
01:07:35.840 --> 01:07:37.280
It is just a bit puddingy. 

1643
01:07:37.320 --> 01:07:40.120
I mean, if I had that in a bowl with custard, I'd be in heaven. 

1644
01:07:40.120 --> 01:07:41.560
But this is supposed to be cake. 

1645
01:07:42.440 --> 01:07:43.200
I like the flavours. 

1646
01:07:43.200 --> 01:07:44.200
Texture's all wrong. 

1647
01:07:44.760 --> 01:07:46.480
Bit simple on the decoration. 

1648
01:07:46.520 --> 01:07:47.040
Yes. 

1649
01:07:50.600 --> 01:07:54.840
The decorations look quite sweet, but I expected that to be a lot more detailed than it is. 

1650
01:07:54.880 --> 01:07:56.360
It's just a little bit simplistic. 

1651
01:07:56.360 --> 01:07:58.880
What you don't know is his grandparents actually lived in a cake. 

1652
01:07:59.160 --> 01:08:00.600
So it's actually very accurate. 

1653
01:08:00.880 --> 01:08:01.240
Yeah. 

1654
01:08:02.480 --> 01:08:02.760
Wow. 

1655
01:08:02.840 --> 01:08:03.240
Wow. 

1656
01:08:03.280 --> 01:08:03.920
Look at that. 

1657
01:08:04.440 --> 01:08:06.080
Well, there's lots of strawberries and cream. 

1658
01:08:11.840 --> 01:08:13.120
Just bowl me over that. 

1659
01:08:13.840 --> 01:08:15.240
There's too much alcohol in there. 

1660
01:08:15.280 --> 01:08:15.760
Do you know? 

1661
01:08:15.800 --> 01:08:16.160
Yeah. 

1662
01:08:16.280 --> 01:08:16.680
Too much. 

1663
01:08:16.720 --> 01:08:19.640
I thought I'd never hear me say this, but he's right. 

1664
01:08:19.680 --> 01:08:25.600
Sponge is lovely and soft, but somehow, if you put booze in a filling, it's modified by the cake. 

1665
01:08:25.600 --> 01:08:27.560
But if it's in the cake, it's everywhere. 

1666
01:08:32.840 --> 01:08:35.800
I love it for the colour and the vibrancy. 

1667
01:08:35.800 --> 01:08:37.480
The decoration and the pipe work. 

1668
01:08:37.520 --> 01:08:38.600
You've done an amazing job. 

1669
01:08:38.600 --> 01:08:39.400
This looks beautiful. 

1670
01:08:39.400 --> 01:08:40.320
This area here. 

1671
01:08:40.320 --> 01:08:42.600
I can see coming home to your mum's flat. 

1672
01:08:42.640 --> 01:08:43.720
Must have been really good. 

1673
01:08:44.920 --> 01:08:46.160
It is chocolate cake. 

1674
01:08:46.200 --> 01:08:47.520
It contains soy sauce. 

1675
01:08:47.680 --> 01:08:48.640
For the umami. 

1676
01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:49.520
Correct. 

1677
01:08:49.720 --> 01:08:50.680
And inside. 

1678
01:08:50.720 --> 01:08:52.400
Christmas inspired buttercream. 

1679
01:08:59.280 --> 01:09:01.480
It is utterly delicious. 

1680
01:09:02.360 --> 01:09:03.880
Just the right amount of spice. 

1681
01:09:04.200 --> 01:09:05.280
Very chocolatey. 

1682
01:09:05.400 --> 01:09:07.720
The textures and the bakes all the way through are delicious. 

1683
01:09:07.760 --> 01:09:08.680
I can't fault it. 

1684
01:09:08.720 --> 01:09:09.600
It's excellent. 

1685
01:09:09.640 --> 01:09:10.280
Thank you. 

1686
01:09:10.320 --> 01:09:10.880
Well done. 

1687
01:09:11.320 --> 01:09:12.400
It's a work of art. 

1688
01:09:15.760 --> 01:09:17.160
Dallas has had. 

1689
01:09:17.640 --> 01:09:18.160
Yeah. 

1690
01:09:18.160 --> 01:09:18.760
That's 

1691
01:09:19.800 --> 01:09:20.840
amazing feedback. 

1692
01:09:22.280 --> 01:09:27.560
If I was named Star Baker, that in my heart would actually be, like winning the competition for me. 

1693
01:09:27.560 --> 01:09:29.000
Because cake is my favorite. 

1694
01:09:30.480 --> 01:09:34.960
They say the cake looks lovely, but it doesn't have a punchy flavor. 

1695
01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:35.360
Yeah. 

1696
01:09:35.360 --> 01:09:35.880
It's fair. 

1697
01:09:35.880 --> 01:09:37.440
I know I made a booboo that way. 

1698
01:09:39.440 --> 01:09:40.760
Could have been worse. 

1699
01:09:40.960 --> 01:09:42.720
But you know, I still feel like I'm. 

1700
01:09:42.720 --> 01:09:44.720
I'm languishing a little bit along the bottom. 

1701
01:09:44.960 --> 01:09:46.080
I'm in danger. 

1702
01:09:46.320 --> 01:09:49.480
To be honest, I don't know whether I've done enough to stay. 

1703
01:09:50.160 --> 01:09:53.480
I'm very happy it went as well as it possibly could have done. 

1704
01:09:53.640 --> 01:09:57.120
I just hope it's enough to be not bottom anymore. 

1705
01:09:59.440 --> 01:10:02.160
Prue and Paul have made their decision. 

1706
01:10:02.800 --> 01:10:04.280
It's going to be okay. 

1707
01:10:04.320 --> 01:10:05.400
It's going to be okay. 

1708
01:10:05.480 --> 01:10:05.880
So. 

1709
01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:14.040
I've got a great job this week of announcing the star Baker. 

1710
01:10:14.040 --> 01:10:18.280
And this week's star baker is. 

1711
01:10:23.840 --> 01:10:24.480
Janusz. 

1712
01:10:30.560 --> 01:10:31.000
Wow. 

1713
01:10:33.600 --> 01:10:37.120
Well, if it was up to me, I'd keep you all here and send one of the judges home. 

1714
01:10:37.480 --> 01:10:38.720
Sadly, it isn't up to me. 

1715
01:10:38.720 --> 01:10:46.880
And we do have to say goodbye to one of you, which feels very early, but the person who is leaving us is. 

1716
01:10:56.640 --> 01:10:57.320
Its will. 

1717
01:11:02.320 --> 01:11:04.760
Well, guys, you go and all knock it out of the park. 

1718
01:11:04.920 --> 01:11:05.360
Honestly. 

1719
01:11:05.360 --> 01:11:07.440
Well, you should just feel proud of yourself. 

1720
01:11:07.520 --> 01:11:08.280
Well done will. 

1721
01:11:08.360 --> 01:11:09.240
Thank you. 

1722
01:11:09.400 --> 01:11:09.640
Dear. 

1723
01:11:09.640 --> 01:11:10.120
Well done. 

1724
01:11:10.440 --> 01:11:11.120
Well done. 

1725
01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:13.600
You know, somebody's got to go first. 

1726
01:11:13.600 --> 01:11:18.400
And and obviously I'm disappointed, but I'm proud to have made it. 

1727
01:11:18.680 --> 01:11:19.040
Yeah. 

1728
01:11:19.080 --> 01:11:19.720
I'm all right. 

1729
01:11:19.880 --> 01:11:21.000
I knew it was going to happen. 

1730
01:11:21.840 --> 01:11:22.680
Conversations. 

1731
01:11:22.720 --> 01:11:25.720
You know, there's obviously a lovely bunch of people I've met. 

1732
01:11:25.760 --> 01:11:28.440
I've got an experience that I can definitely talk about and share. 

1733
01:11:28.840 --> 01:11:29.920
Yeah, I'm proud of that. 

1734
01:11:29.960 --> 01:11:30.640
Proud of that. 

1735
01:11:30.720 --> 01:11:32.080
Bit better next week, please. 

1736
01:11:32.120 --> 01:11:34.760
I need to be a lot neater, a lot neater. 

1737
01:11:35.240 --> 01:11:36.840
Oh, I'm still here. 

1738
01:11:37.240 --> 01:11:41.360
Oh, I literally I can't believe it. 

1739
01:11:41.560 --> 01:11:44.960
I was constantly hearing my name next week. 

1740
01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:48.960
I really want to impress the judges and also make myself proud as well. 

1741
01:11:49.280 --> 01:11:49.640
Well done. 

1742
01:11:49.680 --> 01:11:50.280
Janusz. 

1743
01:11:50.640 --> 01:11:52.320
You absolute rock star. 

1744
01:11:53.400 --> 01:11:57.440
A winning star baker on the cake week means everything to me. 

1745
01:11:57.760 --> 01:11:58.760
And hopefully to you. 

1746
01:11:59.840 --> 01:12:00.720
Are you crying? 

1747
01:12:02.920 --> 01:12:04.560
I've cried so many times. 

1748
01:12:05.240 --> 01:12:06.160
It's crazy. 

1749
01:12:07.640 --> 01:12:09.200
I think my boyfriend would be really proud. 

1750
01:12:09.200 --> 01:12:10.880
And he would say, you can make cake. 

1751
01:12:10.920 --> 01:12:12.400
And I've told you, you can make cake. 

1752
01:12:14.440 --> 01:12:15.240
Well done. 

1753
01:12:15.320 --> 01:12:15.920
Well done. 

1754
01:12:16.080 --> 01:12:16.920
The first star, baby. 

1755
01:12:16.960 --> 01:12:17.440
Thank you. 

1756
01:12:17.600 --> 01:12:18.440
Hey, Honeybun. 

1757
01:12:19.040 --> 01:12:23.240
I just wanted to tell you that I win star cake in the bake week. 

1758
01:12:24.800 --> 01:12:25.280
No, 

1759
01:12:26.560 --> 01:12:27.200
I win. 

1760
01:12:27.240 --> 01:12:27.600
No! 

1761
01:12:32.640 --> 01:12:33.560
Next time. 

1762
01:12:33.600 --> 01:12:34.280
Goodbye. 

1763
01:12:34.360 --> 01:12:35.320
It's biscuit. 

1764
01:12:35.320 --> 01:12:35.640
Week. 

1765
01:12:35.680 --> 01:12:36.560
Say a little prayer. 

1766
01:12:36.600 --> 01:12:38.120
A signature illusion. 

1767
01:12:38.160 --> 01:12:40.080
What could go wrong with a macaron? 

1768
01:12:40.120 --> 01:12:40.560
Whoa! 

1769
01:12:40.920 --> 01:12:41.200
Ah! 

1770
01:12:41.360 --> 01:12:43.320
Everything could go wrong with a macaron. 

1771
01:12:43.360 --> 01:12:44.680
A classical technical. 

1772
01:12:44.720 --> 01:12:46.040
I don't know what that is. 

1773
01:12:46.080 --> 01:12:47.800
That creates a buzz in the tent. 

1774
01:12:47.840 --> 01:12:48.960
Squashed biscuits. 

1775
01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:50.280
That's what my mom called them. 

1776
01:12:50.320 --> 01:12:51.320
Well, where's your gob? 

1777
01:12:51.360 --> 01:12:53.040
And the bakers face off 

1778
01:12:54.080 --> 01:12:56.400
as they make showstopping masks. 

1779
01:13:00.080 --> 01:13:01.160
Oh, I might cry. 

1780
01:13:01.600 --> 01:13:02.440
I might cry.
